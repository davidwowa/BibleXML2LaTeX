    <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE) : This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.   In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.   The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version. This digital text follows the 1996 printing.</description>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="40" bname="Matthew" bsname="Mat">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Here are the names of the people in the family line from which Jesus Christ came. He came from David’s family. He came from Abraham’s family. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (2-16) </STYLE>Jesus’ family line: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez (his mother was Tamar), Zezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz (his mother was Rahab), Obed (his mother was Ruth), Jesse, David the king, Solomon (whose mother was Uriah’s wife), Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joram, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, Jeconiah and his brothers (at the time the people of Israel were carried away to Babylon), Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim, Eliud, Eleazor, Matthan, Jacob and Joseph who was the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There were fourteen families from Abraham to David. There were fourteen families from David to the time the people were taken to Babylon. And there were fourteen families after that until Christ was born. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This is the way Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, was promised to Joseph to be his wife. But before they were married, she found out that she was going to have a baby. It was by the Holy Spirit. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Joseph, the man she was to marry, was a good man. He did not want her to be made ashamed. So he planned to leave her without telling people about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">While he was thinking about this, he had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him. He said, ‘Joseph, David’s son, do not fear to take Mary to be your wife. Her baby is by the Holy Spirit. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She will have a baby son. Name him Jesus, because he will save his people from the wrong things they have done.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All of this had been told long before by the Lord through his prophet. It came true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The prophet said, ‘A young woman who has not slept with a man is going to have a baby son. His name will be Emmanuel. That means “God is with us.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Joseph woke up and did what the angel of the Lord told him to do. He took Mary to be his wife. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he did not make love with her until her first son had been born. He named him Jesus.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem, in the country of Judea. Herod was the king. After Jesus was born, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They asked, ‘Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star rising and we have come to worship him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When King Herod heard this, he was very troubled. All the people in Jerusalem were troubled also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He called all the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews for a meeting. He asked them, ‘Where is the Christ to be born?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They told him, ‘In Bethlehem in Judea. That is what the prophet, the man of God long ago, wrote: </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">“Bethlehem in the country of Judah, you are not the least among the leaders in Judah. A leader will come from you who will rule over my people Israel.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod called the wise men to talk with them secretly. He found out from them what time they saw the star. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, ‘Go and ask everywhere until you find the child. When you have found him, come and tell me, so that I myself may go and worship him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After they heard what the king said, they went away. And the star, which they had seen rising, went in front of them. It stopped above the place where the child was. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they were very glad. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They went into the house, and there they saw the child and Mary his mother. They kneeled down and worshipped him. Then they opened their bags and gave him gifts. These gifts were gold, and frankincense and myrrh. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In a dream they were told not to go back to Herod. So they went home by a different road. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him and said, ‘Get up. Take the child and his mother, and go quickly to the country of Egypt. Stay there till I tell you, because Herod will try to find the child and kill him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother in the night and went to Egypt. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He stayed there until Herod died. What the Lord told through his prophet long ago, came true. He said ‘I called my son out of Egypt.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him. He was very angry. He sent men to kill all the baby boys in the town of Bethlehem and around it. They killed all the boys who were two years old or less. Herod remembered what the wise men had told him about the time they first saw the star. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So what the prophet Jeremiah said, came true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, ‘A voice could be heard in the town of Ramah. Rachel was crying for her children. She would not let anyone comfort her because her children were dead.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Herod died. Then Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him in Egypt. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The angel said, ‘Get up. Take the child and his mother and go to the country of Israel. The men who wanted to kill the child are dead.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother and went to the country of Israel. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in his father Herod’s place. So he was afraid to go there. In a dream he was told what to do. He went to the country of Galilee. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He went and made his home in the town of Nazareth. The prophets of God long ago had said, ‘He shall be called a man from Nazareth.’ What they said came true.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After some years had passed, John the Baptizer came and told God’s word in the desert of Judea. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, ‘Stop doing wrong things and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is almost here.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This is the man that Isaiah the prophet of God spoke about long ago. He said, ‘A man is calling in the wilderness, “Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John wore clothes made of camel’s hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">People went to him from Jerusalem, from all of Judea, and from all the country near the Jordan River. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He baptised them in the Jordan River when they said how sorry they were for the wrong things they had done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Many of the Pharisee group and the Sadducee group came to him to be baptised. But when he saw them, he said to them, ‘You family of snakes! Who told you to run away from God’s anger that is coming? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Stop your wrong ways to show that you have turned back to God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not think you can say to yourselves, “Abraham is our father.” I tell you, God can make children for Abraham from these stones. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The axe is ready to cut down the trees. Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">‘I baptise you with water when you stop your wrong ways. But another person is coming after me. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to take off his shoes. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean. He will put the grain into his storehouse. But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never dies.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He came to John to be baptised by him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">John tried to stop him. He said, ‘I need to be baptised by you. Why do you come to me to be baptised?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus answered, ‘Please do it now. In this way we shall do all that is right.’ Then John let him be baptised. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">After Jesus was baptised, he came up out of the water right away. The sky opened. He saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">A voice from the sky said, ‘This is my dear Son. I am very pleased with him.’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert. The devil tried to make Jesus do wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus did not eat anything for forty days and forty nights. Then he was very hungry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The one who tries to make people do wrong came and said to him, ‘If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to be changed into bread.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus answered him, ‘The holy writings say, “Man cannot live on bread only. He needs to live by every word that God says.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He put him on a high part of the temple. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The devil said to him, ‘If you are God’s Son, jump down. The holy writings say, “God will tell his angels to take care of you. They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered him, ‘The holy writings say, “You must not test the Lord your God.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The devil took Jesus to a very high hill. He showed him all the countries of the world and how great they were. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to Jesus, ‘I will give you all these if you kneel down and worship me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus answered him, ‘Get away, Satan. The holy writings say, “You must worship the Lord your God, and he is the only one you are to worship.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus heard that John was put in prison, so he went to Galilee. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He left the town of Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum. It is by the sea (of Galilee) in the district of Zebulun and Naphtali. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So what the prophet Isaiah said came true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He talked about, ‘The country of Zebulun and the country of Naphtali, the road by the sea, the land on the other side of the Jordan River, Galilee where the people are not Jews.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, ‘The people who lived in darkness have seen a great Light. Light has come to those who lived in a land covered by the dark shadow of death.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From then on, Jesus began to tell God’s word to the people. He said, ‘Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is here!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon who later was named Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to them, ‘Come with me. The work I will give you will be to catch people.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Right away they left their nets and went with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus went on from there and saw two other brothers, James and John. Their father’s name was Zebedee. They were in the boat with their father mending their nets. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus called them. Right away they left the boat and their father and went with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus went all around through Galilee. He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news about the kingdom of heaven. He healed all the sick and weak people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The people in all the country of Syria heard about him. They brought all who were sick in any way, or had bad spirits in them, and those who could not walk or use their hands. Jesus healed them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Many people went with him. They came from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan river.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus saw the many people, he went up on a hill. He sat down and his disciples came to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He began to teach the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, ‘God makes happy those who know that they need him. The kingdom of heaven is for them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">‘God makes happy those who are sad. They will have comfort. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">‘God makes happy those who quietly trust him and do not try to get their own way. The world will belong to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">‘God makes happy those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right and good. They will be filled. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">‘God makes happy those who are kind. He will be kind to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">‘God makes happy those who have clean hearts. They will see God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">‘God makes happy those who make peace between people. They will be called God’s sons. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">‘God makes happy those who have trouble for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is for them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">‘God makes you happy when people say wrong things about you, when they trouble you, and when they say all kinds of lies about you. God makes you happy when it is for my sake. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Be happy and glad because God will be good to you in heaven. In the same way people troubled the prophets before your time.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">‘You are like salt in the world. If salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? Salt that has no taste is good for nothing. The only thing to do is to throw it out on the road. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">‘You are like light in the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So also with a lamp. People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket. But they put it on the place for a lamp. Then all the people in the house can see its light. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So, let your light shine to all people. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">‘Do not think that I have come to take away the law and the writings of the prophets. No, I have not come to take them away. But I have come to do what they say must be done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I tell you the truth. Until the sky and the earth are taken away, not one small part of the law will be taken away, until everything has been done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So anyone who does not obey one of the smallest laws, and teaches other people not to obey it, will have the smallest part in the kingdom of heaven. But any one who obeys and teaches the law, will have a big part in the kingdom of heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I tell you, you must do much better than the scribes and Pharisees. If you do not, then you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">‘You have heard this said to men long ago, “Do not kill. Anyone who kills will be judged in court.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">‘But I tell you this. Anyone who is angry with his brother without having a good reason, will be judged in court. Anyone who says wrong things to his brother will be judged for it in the big court. Anyone who says “You fool!” will be judged to go into hell fire. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">‘Perhaps you are bringing your gift to God at his altar. There you remember that your brother has something against you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If so, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First, go to your brother and make things right with him. Then come and give your gift to God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">‘If someone wants to take you to court, make an agreement with him quickly on the way. If you do not, he will take you to the judge. The judge will give you to the guard, and the guard will put you in prison. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I tell you the truth, you will not get out of prison until you have paid every piece of money.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">‘You have heard that the law says, “Do not commit adultery [have another man or woman who is not your husband or wife].” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I tell you that if a man looks at a woman and he wants her, then he has already committed adultery with her in his heart. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">‘If your right eye makes you do wrong, take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">If your right hand makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell fire. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">‘The law said, “Any man who does not want to keep his wife must give her a paper to tell others she is no longer his wife.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I tell you, no man may send away his wife unless she has committed adultery. If he does send her away, he is making her commit adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away from her husband, he commits adultery.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">‘Also you have heard this said to men long ago, “You must not make a promise in God’s name and break it.” And, “You must do for the Lord what you said you would do.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">‘But I tell you, do not make a promise in God’s name. Do not use the name of heaven, because that is where God rules. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Do not use the name of earth, because that is where God rests his feet. Do not use the name of Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Do not make a promise by your head, because you cannot make one hair of your head white or black. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You must mean “Yes” when you say “Yes”. You must mean “No” when you say “No”. To say anything more than that is wrong.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">‘You have heard that the law says, “Take an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But I tell you, do not fight with anyone who does wrong to you. But if someone hits you on one side of your face, turn the other side to him also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">‘If anyone takes you to court to get your shirt, let him have your coat also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">If anyone wants you to help carry a load, go with him twice as far. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When someone wants to borrow something from you, let him have it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">‘You have heard that the law says, “Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But I tell you, love your enemies. Ask God to do good to those who trouble you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">In that way you will be sons of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun shine on both wrong and good people. He lets the rain fall on people who do right and on people who do wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">If you love only those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Do you speak to your brothers only? If so, you are not doing any better than other people. Even people who do not believe in God do that. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">You must be good in every way, as your Father in heaven is good in every way.’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Do not do good things so that people will see you do them. If you do, you will get no reward from your Father in heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">‘So when you give money to poor people, do not send men in front of you to blow trumpets or horns. Some people do this in the meeting houses and on the streets so that people will praise them. They are not true to themselves. I tell you the truth. They have their pay already. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when you give money to poor people, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In this way, what you give to the poor will be secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">‘When you talk to God, do not be like people who are not true to themselves. They like to stand and talk to God in the meeting houses and at the street corners, so that people will see them. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when you talk to God, go into your room and shut the door. Then talk to your Father in secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">‘And when you talk to God, do not say words that mean nothing, over and over again. People who do not believe in God do that. They think their god will hear them because they say many words. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So talk to your God like this: “Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">“May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">“Give us our food for today. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">“Forgive us for the wrong things we have done, the way we forgive those who have done wrong things to us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">“Do not test us but help us, so that no one will make us do wrong. Deliver us from the evil one. The kingdom and power and praise belong to you for ever. Amen!” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">‘If you forgive others for the wrong things they have done, then your Father in heaven will forgive you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">‘When you are fasting [not eating food for a time], do not look sad. That is what people do who are not true to themselves. They look sad to show people they are fasting. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face as you do at other times. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then people will not see that you are fasting. But your Father sees secret things, and he will reward you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">‘Do not keep many things for yourself on earth. Insects and rust will spoil them. People will get in and steal them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But keep things for yourself in heaven. Insects and rust will not spoil them there. People will not get in and steal them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The place where you keep things is where your heart will be also.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">‘The body gets its light through the eyes. If you have good eyes, all your body will have light. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But if your eyes are bad, all your body will be in darkness. If the light in you is dark, it will be very dark for you.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus did not answer her. His disciples came to him and said, ‘Send her away. She keeps calling after us.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said, ‘I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the woman came and bowed down in front of Jesus and worshipped him. She said, ‘Sir, help me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He said, ‘It is not right to take the children’s food and give it to the little dogs.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She answered, ‘Yes, sir. But even the little dogs eat the food that falls from the tables of their masters.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered, ‘Woman, you believe very much. The thing you want me to do will be done.’ And her daughter was healed at that very time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus went on from there along the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat down there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Many people came to him. They brought sick people with them. Some were lame. Some were hurt. Some were blind. Some could not talk. And there were many others. They laid them down in front of Jesus. And he healed them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The people were surprised. They saw that people who had not been able to talk were talking. They saw that people who were hurt were made well. They saw that lame people were walking. They saw that blind people could see. And they praised the God of Israel. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus called his disciples to him. He said, ‘I share the suffering of the people. They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If they go away hungry, they will get weak and fall on the way.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The disciples said to him, ‘Where can we get enough food in this lonely place to feed so many people?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to them, ‘How many loaves of bread have you?’ They said, ‘We have seven, and a few small fish.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He told the people to sit down on the ground. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he took the seven loaves of bread and the fish. He thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples. The disciples gave it to the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They all ate and had enough. They gathered seven baskets full of pieces that were left. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The number of people who ate was about four thousand men, besides some women and children. </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus. They wanted to test him, so they asked him to show them a sign from the sky. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He answered them, ‘In the evening you say, “It will be a nice day tomorrow because the sky is red.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In the morning you say, “It will be a stormy day, because the sky is red and there are clouds.” You know the meaning of these signs in the sky. But you do not know the meaning of the signs about the time in which we are living. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">People today are wrong. They have gone away from God. They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah.’ Then Jesus went away and left them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the disciples reached the other side of the sea, they found they had forgotten to bring any bread with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said, ‘Watch! Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The disciples said to each other, ‘He said that because we did not bring any bread.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, ‘You don’t believe very much in me. Why are you saying to each other, “We have no bread”. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do you not yet understand? When there were five thousand people, there were only five loaves of bread. Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When there were four thousand people, there were only seven loaves. Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why do you not understand that I was not talking about bread? Take care. Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they understood that he was not talking about bread. He did not mean that the yeast of bread would spoil them. They understood that he was talking about the things the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus went to the country of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, ‘I am the Son of Man. Whom do people say I am?’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to them, ‘Whom do you say I am?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter answered, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time on, Jesus began to teach his disciples. He said, ‘I must go to Jerusalem. I will have much trouble from the leaders, the chief priests, and the scribes. I will be killed. On the third day, I will be raised from death.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Peter took him to one side and began to talk to him. He said, ‘Lord! May God stop it! This must never happen to you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But Jesus turned to Peter and said, ‘Get away from me Satan! You are trying to make me do wrong. You are not thinking the way God thinks, but the way people think.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus told his disciples, ‘If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. He must be willing to carry his cross and come with me. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Six days after this, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John with him. He led them up a hill by themselves. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus was changed in front of them. His face was bright like the sun. His clothes were white, like light. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter said to Jesus, ‘Lord, this is a good place for us. If you want, we will make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he was saying this, a bright cloud came over them. A voice in the cloud said, ‘This is my dear Son. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the disciples heard it, they bowed their faces to the ground. They were very much afraid. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jesus came and touched them. He said, ‘Get up. Do not fear.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they came down the hill, Jesus said to them, ‘Do not tell anyone what you saw. Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The disciples asked him, ‘Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, ‘Elijah does come. He will get everything ready. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I tell you that Elijah has come already. The people did not know him. And they did to him just what they wanted to do. So also the Son of Man will be troubled by them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples knew that he was talking about John the Baptizer. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They came to the people. A man came and kneeled in front of Jesus. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said, ‘You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus talked to the bad spirit and he came out of the boy. The boy was healed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus alone. They asked him, ‘Why could we not drive the bad spirit out?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus said to them, ‘Because you do not believe enough. I tell you the truth. If your strength to believe were as much as a little mustard seed, you could say to this hill, “Go, move over to that place!” And it would move. Nothing is too hard for you to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this kind of bad spirit does not come out of a person unless people ask God and fast [do not eat food for a time].’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were travelling in Galilee. Jesus said to his disciples, ‘The Son of Man will be given over to men. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They will kill him. But he will be raised on the third day.’ This troubled the disciples very much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They came to Capernaum. There the men who were collecting the tax for the temple came to Peter. They asked him, ‘Does not your teacher pay the tax for the temple?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Peter said, ‘Yes, he does.’ When he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him about it first. He said, ‘Simon, what do you think? From whom do kings on earth take taxes? Do they take them from their own people or from other people?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Peter said, ‘From other people.’ Jesus said, ‘Then the sons do not pay a tax. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But we must not make them think something wrong about us. So go to the sea. Throw a fish-hook into the water. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth and you will see a piece of money. Take it and pay them the tax for you and me.’      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The disciples came to Jesus at that time. They said, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to Jesus, ‘Then why did Moses make this law? He said that a man may give his wife a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said to them, ‘Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard. That is why he let you send your wives away. But in the beginning it was not that way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I tell you this. No man may send his wife away unless she has committed adultery. If he does, and if he marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said, ‘Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to live for ever, you must keep God’s laws.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The man said, ‘Which laws?’ Jesus said, ‘Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not tell lies. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus and his disciples came near to Jerusalem. They came to the village of Bethphage by the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">They brought the donkey and her young one. They put their coats on them. Then Jesus got on to ride. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut leaves from the palm trees and put them on the road. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">People in front of him and people behind him shouted, ‘Praise the Son of David! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord! Praise him in heaven!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus came into Jerusalem, all the people there were very excited. They said, ‘Who is this?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The people who were with Jesus said, ‘This is Jesus from the town of Nazareth in Galilee. He is a prophet.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus went into the temple of God. He drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said to them, ‘The holy writings say, “My house shall be called a house where people talk with God.” But you have made it a place for people who steal!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Blind people came to Jesus in the temple. People who could not walk came to him. And he healed them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The chief priests and the scribes saw the big works that Jesus did. They saw the children calling out in the temple, ‘God save the Son of David!’ They were angry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They asked Jesus, ‘Do you hear what they are saying?’ Jesus answered, ‘Yes. Have you never read this? “You like the praise of children and babies.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany. He stayed there for the night. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In the morning he went back to the city. On the way he was hungry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Along the road he saw a fig tree. He went to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. He said to the tree, ‘No fruit will ever grow on you again!’ Right away the tree died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The disciples saw it and were surprised. They said, ‘So soon the fig tree has died!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to them, ‘I tell you the truth. Believe God. Do not doubt him. Then you can do what I did to this fig tree. But that is not all. You can even say to this hill, “Go and jump into the sea” and it will be done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When you ask God for anything, believe that you will have it. Then you will have it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He came to the temple and went in and taught the people. The chief priests and the leaders of the people came to him. They asked, ‘What right have you to do these things? Who gave you the right to do them?’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men?’ So they talked it over together. They said, ‘If we say, “God gave John the right to do it,” he will say to us, “Then why did you not believe him?” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if we say, “Men gave him the right to do it,” we have the people to fear, because all the people say that John was a prophet.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So they answered Jesus, ‘We do not know.’ Then Jesus said, ‘Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">‘What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first one and said, “Son, go and work today on my farm.” </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Which of the two sons did what his father wanted him to do?’ They said, ‘The first one.’ Then Jesus said, ‘I tell you the truth. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery by selling their bodies, are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">John came to you to tell you the right way. But you did not believe him. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery believed him. And even when you saw that, you did not change your minds and believe him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">‘Listen to another story. A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes. He put a fence of small trees around it.

      <VERS vnumber="40">When the owner of the farm comes, what will he do to those men?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They answered, ‘He will kill those bad men, and will give the farm to other men who will give him the fruit when it is time.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said, ‘Have you never read in the holy writings “The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone. The Lord did this. It looks wonderful to us”? </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the stories Jesus told, and they knew he was talking about them. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus told them other stories. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, ‘The kingdom of heaven is like this. A king made a wedding for his son. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">‘He sent other servants to call them. He said, “Tell those who were asked to the wedding that my dinner is cooked. The cows and bullocks have been killed. Everything is ready. Come now to the wedding.” </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">The others caught his servants, treated them very badly, and killed them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">‘The king was very angry. He sent his soldiers to kill the men who had killed his servants. And he burned their city. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to his servants, “The wedding is ready. But those who were asked to come were not good enough. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Go out on the roads. Call all the people you find to come to the wedding.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">‘So those servants went out on the roads. They brought all the people they could find, both bad and good people. Then the room was full of people for the wedding. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">‘Many people are asked to come, but only a few are chosen.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees went away. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They sent their disciples to him with some of Herod’s people. They said, ‘Teacher, we know that you are true. We know that you teach the true way of God. You do not fear any person, or care how great he is. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So tell us. What do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble. So he said to them, ‘Why are you trying to get me to do wrong? You are not true to yourselves! </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">When they heard that, they were surprised. They left him and went away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. They say that people do not rise from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They came to ask him a question. They said, ‘Teacher, Moses gave us this law: “If a man dies and has no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother.” </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">When the people heard this, they were surprised at his teaching. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said, ‘“Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul, and love him with all your mind.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the first and greatest law. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then at that time the chief priests and the leaders of the people met together in the house of the high priest. His name was Caiaphas. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, ‘Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in the house of Simon, a man who had leprosy, a bad skin disease. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put the oil on Jesus’ head. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the disciples saw this, they were angry. They said, ‘Why was the oil wasted like that? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The oil might have been sold for much money. Then the money could have been given to poor people.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus heard it, he said to them, ‘Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good thing to me. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">They were very sad and troubled. One after the other they began to say to him, ‘Lord, is it I?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered them, ‘The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, ‘Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, ‘All of you drink from this. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">They sang a song and then went out to the hill called the Mount of Olives. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus said to them, ‘All of you will leave me this night. The holy writings say, “I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said, ‘Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you!’ All the disciples said the same thing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, ‘Sit down here. I will go over there and talk with God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, ‘My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch with me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus went on a little further. He bowed down with his face to the ground. He talked to God and said, ‘My Father, if it can be, let this cup of trouble pass by me. But do not do what I want. May what you want be done.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, ‘What? Could you not watch with me for one hour? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and talk with God, so that you will not do wrong. A person’s heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus went away again. He talked to God and said, ‘My Father, if you do not want this cup to pass by me, but you want me to drink it, I will do what you want.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He left them and went away again. He talked with God the third time and said the same words. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he went back to his disciples and said to them, ‘Are you still sleeping and resting? The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">As Jesus was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests and the leaders of the people had sent them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, ‘The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and hold him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Right then he went to Jesus and said, ‘Greetings, Master!’ And he kissed him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, ‘Friend, why have you come?’ Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand. He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to him, ‘Put your sword back in its place. All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father, and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But then, how would God’s word come true? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">At that same time Jesus said to the people, ‘Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught. But you did not try to catch me then. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true.’ Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The men who caught Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the leaders had met at his house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Peter followed Jesus a long way behind. He went as far as the yard of the high priest’s house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He wanted to see how this would end. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">The chief priests and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But they found nothing. Many people came and said things that were not true. At last two men came. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">They said, ‘This man said, “I can break down God’s temple and build it again in three days.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">The high priest stood up. He said to Jesus, ‘Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest said to him, ‘I ask you in the name of the living God. Tell us. Are you the Christ, the Son of God?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus answered him, ‘Yes, I am. Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, ‘What he has said is wrong! We do not need any more proof against him. You have heard the wrong thing he said. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What do you think?’ They said, ‘He should be killed.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spat on Jesus’ face and hit him. Others slapped him with their hands. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">They said, ‘Christ, tell us, if you know who hit you!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl came to him and said, ‘You were also with Jesus of Galilee.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But Peter said in front of them all, ‘I do not know what you are talking about.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Peter went out to the gate. There, another servant-girl saw him. She said to the others around there, ‘This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Peter said some bad words and then said, ‘I do not know the man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">A little later, those standing around came to Peter and said, ‘Surely you are one of them also. We know it by the way you talk.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then Peter began to say even more bad words. He said, ‘I do not know the man!’ Right then, a cock called. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said, ‘Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.’ Then Peter went out and cried very much.      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When it was morning, all the chief priests and the leaders of the people made a plan against Jesus. They wanted to kill him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They tied him and took him away. They took him to Pilate, the ruler. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas was the man who helped them take Jesus. He saw that they had judged Jesus and were going to kill him. He was sorry for what he had done, so he brought the thirty pieces of silver money back to the chief priests and leaders. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said, ‘I have done wrong. I have helped you take a good man who should not be killed.’ They said, ‘What do we care? You look after that!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Judas threw the silver money into the temple. He went away and hanged himself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The chief priests took the money. They said, ‘It is not right to put this money in the money box of the temple. It has been used to buy a man’s death.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They talked the matter over and bought a field that belonged to a man who made pots. They bought it for a place in which to bury strangers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is why that field has been called ‘The field of blood’ until now. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What Jeremiah the prophet said long ago, then came true at that time. He said, ‘They took thirty pieces of silver money. That is what the people of Israel said he was worth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They paid for the potter’s field. That is what the Lord told me to do.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">They said, ‘He saved other people but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of the people of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. Then we will believe in him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted in God. If God wants him, he can save him now. He said, “I am God’s Son.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The bad men who were also nailed to crosses with him said the same things to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">About midday, the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">About three o’clock, Jesus called out loud, ‘Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?’ That means, ‘My God, my God, why have you left me alone?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said. They said ‘This man is calling for Elijah.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Right away, one of them ran to get something called a sponge. He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick. With it he gave Jesus a drink. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The other people said, ‘Wait. We will see if Elijah will come and save him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus called out loud again. Then he died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">At that time the thick cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces. It was torn from the top down to the bottom. The earth shook and big rocks broke. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The graves opened. Many of God’s people who had died rose from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They came out of their graves after Jesus rose from death. They went into Jerusalem. Many people saw them there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">The Roman captain and some of his soldiers were guarding Jesus on the cross. When they saw the earth shake and the other things happen, they were very much afraid. They said, ‘Surely this man was God’s Son.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Many women were there watching from far away. They had come with Jesus from Galilee and had helped him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">In the evening, a rich man came. He was Joseph from the town of Arimathea. He also believed in Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate said that it should be given to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Joseph took the body and wrapped a clean linen cloth around it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">He put the body in his own new grave which had been cut in a rock. He rolled a very big stone to close the grave. Then he went away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there. They sat where they could see the grave. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">The next day was the Sabbath day. The chief priests and Pharisees went to Pilate together. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">They said, ‘Sir, that man fooled people. We remember what he said when he was still living. He said that he would rise after three days. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">So give orders that the grave must be guarded for three days. Then his disciples cannot come in the night to carry away his body, and tell people he rose from death. This last trick would be worse than the first.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, ‘Take soldiers. Go and guard the grave as well as you can.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went and shut the grave tight. They put a government mark on the big stone. And the soldiers stayed to guard it. This was to make sure the grave would stay shut.      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Sabbath day was past. Morning light was beginning to shine on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the grave. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The earth shook very much because an angel of the Lord came down from heaven. He came and rolled the big stone away from the grave and sat on it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His face shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The soldiers who were guarding the grave saw him and shook with fear. They fell down like dead men. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The angel talked to the women. He said, ‘Do not fear. I know you are looking for Jesus, who was nailed to a cross. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here. He has risen, as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Go quickly and tell his disciples, “He has risen from death. He is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there.” Now, I have told you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The women went quickly away. They left the grave with fear and they were very happy. They ran to tell his disciples. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As they were going, Jesus met them. He said ‘Greetings!’ The women bowed down in front of him and put their hands on his feet. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them, ‘Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had guarded the grave came into the city. They told the chief priests all that had happened. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The chief priests had a meeting with the leaders of the people and talked the matter over. They gave much money to the soldiers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They said, ‘Tell the people, “His disciples came by night and took away the body while we were sleeping.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If the ruler hears about this, then we will talk to him so that he will not punish you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The soldiers took the money. They did as they were told to do. And even to this day, many of the Jewish leaders say this is what happened to Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the hill where Jesus had told them to meet him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they saw him, they bowed down in front of him. But some people were not sure. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus came and talked to them. He said, ‘All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, God’s Son. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The men of God, called prophets, long ago wrote about it this way: God said, ‘See, I send my man ahead of you to tell about you. He will make the way ready for you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">A man is calling out in the desert, “Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John baptised people in the desert. He told them to stop doing wrong things and be baptised, and God would forgive them for the wrong things they did. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">People from all the land of Judea and all the city of Jerusalem went out to John. He baptised them in the Jordan River when they told about the wrong things they did. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">John wore clothes made of camel’s hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He told the people, ‘Another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoe strings. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the country of Galilee. John baptised him in the Jordan River. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As soon as he came up out of the water, Jesus saw the sky open. He saw God’s Holy Spirit come down on him like a bird called a dove. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A voice from the sky said, ‘You are my dear Son. I am very pleased with you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Right away, the Spirit made Jesus go into the desert. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus was in the desert for forty days. All that time Satan tried to make Jesus do wrong. Jesus was with wild animals. Angels came and took care of him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">John was put in prison. Then Jesus went to Galilee. He told people the good news of God’s kingdom. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘The kingdom of God is here. Stop your wrong ways, turn back to God and believe the good news.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to them, ‘Come with me. The work I give you will be to catch people.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Right away they left their nets and went with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus went on from there and saw James and his brother John. Their father’s name was Zebedee. They were in a boat mending their nets. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus called them. Right away they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen and went with Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They went to the town of Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath day, Jesus went into their meeting house and taught the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were very much surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them. He did not teach them like their teachers called scribes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house at that time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He called out, ‘Jesus of Nazareth, what do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to the spirit, ‘Be quiet! Come out of him!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The bad spirit threw the man around. It called out loud and then it came out of the man. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The people were all surprised. They said one to another, ‘What is this? Is not this a new teaching? He tells the bad spirits what to do and even they obey him’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The people all around Galilee heard right away about Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As soon as they came out of the meeting house, they went to the home of Simon and Andrew. James and John went also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Simon’s wife’s mother was sick and was lying down. She had a fever. Right away they told Jesus about her. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her right away, and she began to do things to help them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">That evening when the sun went down, people brought to Jesus all the sick people and those who had bad spirits. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">All the people in the city crowded around the door. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He healed many sick people. He drove the bad spirits out of people. And he did not let them speak because they knew who he was. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The next morning Jesus got up long before daylight. He went out to a place by himself. There he talked with God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Simon and his friends went out after Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">When they found him they said, ‘Everyone is looking for you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus said, ‘We must go to the next towns. I must tell the good news to the people there too. That is why I came here.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then Jesus talked to the people in all the meeting houses in all the country of Galilee. He also made the bad spirits come out of people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">A man who was sick with leprosy [a bad skin disease] came to him. He kneeled down and begged Jesus saying, ‘I know you can heal me if you want to.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus was very sorry for him. He put out his hand and touched him. He said, ‘I want to. Be healed.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">As soon as he said this, the disease left the man and he was healed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus talked strongly to him and sent him away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He said, ‘Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you. Moses gave a law about the gift you must give to God when you are healed. Give it to prove to people that you are healed.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But the man went out and told everyone everywhere what had happened to him. Because he did this, Jesus could not go into any large town freely. He stayed in places where only a few people were. There people came to him from everywhere.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After a few days he came back to Capernaum. People soon heard that he was at home. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many came together right away. The house was full. There was no more room, not even outside near the door. Jesus was telling them God’s message. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Four men brought a sick man to Jesus. The man could not move his arms or legs. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. They made a hole in the roof. Then they let down the mat with the sick man on it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to the sick man, ‘Son, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Some of the scribes were sitting there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They were thinking, ‘Why does this man say such wrong things against God? He is not giving God respect! Who can forgive the wrong things people do? No one but God can do that.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus understood in his spirit what the scribes were thinking. He said right away, ‘Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the sick man, “The wrong things you have done are forgiven,” or to say, “Get up. Take up your mat and walk”? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive the wrong things people do.’ So he said to the sick man, </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">‘I tell you, get up! Take up your mat and go home.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his mat and went home. They were all very much surprised, and they praised God. They said, ‘We have never seen anything like this before.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus went out again by the seaside. Many people came to him. So he taught them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. He was sitting at the place where people come to pay taxes. Jesus said to him, ‘Come with me.’ Levi stood up and went with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus was eating in Levi’s house. Many tax collectors and bad people also came. They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples. There were many who went with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus ate with these people. They said to the disciples, ‘Why does he eat and drink with bad people?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus heard it. He said to them, ‘People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him. I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples were fasting [not eating food for a time]. Some people came to Jesus and said, ‘The disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast. Why do your disciples not do the same?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered them, ‘The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will fast. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">No person sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will tear the old coat. Then the hole is bigger than it was before. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">No person puts new wine into old wine skins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins. Then the wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled. New wine is put into new skins.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus was walking through the grainfields on the Sabbath day. His disciples began to pick some of the seed (to eat) as they went along. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Pharisees said to Jesus, ‘Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, ‘Have you not read what David did? He and his men who were with him were hungry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He went into God’s house when Abiathar was the high priest. Some bread was there for God. It was not right for them to eat it. Only the priests have the right to eat it. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the people who were with him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus went on to say, ‘The Sabbath was made for the good of man. Man was not made for the Sabbath. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus went into the meeting house again. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, ‘Stand here.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then he spoke to the Pharisees. He said, ‘Is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so they will live, or to let them die?’ But the Pharisees said nothing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus was angry as he looked at them. And he was sad that their hearts were so hard. Then he said to the man, ‘Hold out your hand.’ The man did so, and it was made well like the other hand. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Pharisees went out. Right away they and the servants of King Herod planned together how to kill Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (7-8) </STYLE>Jesus and his disciples went away to the sea of Galilee. Many people went with Jesus. They came from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and from the other side of the Jordan River. And many more people came also, a great many from around the cities of Tyre and Sidon. They also had heard about the great works that Jesus had done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus saw that the crowd was very big. He told the disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that he would have more room. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He did this because he healed many people. All who were sick tried to touch him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When the bad spirits saw Jesus, they bowed down before him. They shouted, ‘You are God’s Son!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He told them they must not tell anyone who he was. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus went up on the hill. He wanted some of the people to come with him. So he called them and they came. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He chose twelve disciples to stay with him. He wanted to send them out to other places to tell people God’s word. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He gave them power to heal people and to drive bad spirits out of people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">One of the twelve was Simon, whom Jesus called Peter. </VERS>

        <STYLE fs="super"> (18-19) </STYLE>He also chose Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon of Canan, and Judas Iscariot, the one who gave Jesus over to people who hated him. Then Jesus and his disciples went home. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So many people came again that they could not even eat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Jesus’ family heard about this, they came to take him away. They said, ‘He is crazy.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The scribes who came from Jerusalem also talked about Jesus. They said, ‘Beelzebub, the chief of bad spirits, is in this man. He drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus called the people and talked to them in stories. He asked, ‘How can Satan drive out Satan? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If one part of a country fights against another part of the country, that country cannot be strong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If one part of a family fights against the other part of the family, it cannot stand. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">Many people were sitting around him. They said, ‘See, your mother and your brothers are outside. They want you.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much ground covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die. So no seeds grew on them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But some seed fell on good ground. That seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to them, ‘Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Later, Jesus was alone. Then the twelve disciples and the other people who were there asked him about the stories. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He said to them, ‘You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But we must use stories to tell the other people. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Jesus said, ‘The kingdom of God is like this. A man sows some seed in the ground. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he goes on just as he did before. He sleeps at night and wakes up in the morning. The seed begins to grow but he doesn’t know what makes it grow. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The ground itself makes the seed grow. First the plant comes up. Then it begins to have seed of its own. After a while the harvest is ready. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When the harvest is really ready, he cuts it right away because the harvest time has come.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus said, ‘What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I say it is like? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is like this. A mustard seed is the smallest seed that is ever planted in the earth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But the plant that grows from that seed is bigger than any other plant. It puts out very big branches. The birds come and live in its branches.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">He did not tell them anything without a story. When he was alone with his disciples, he told them the meaning of the stories. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">The disciples left the people and took Jesus away in the boat he was in. Other little boats were with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">A very strong wind began to blow. Water came in the boat. It began to fill up with water. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus was in the back end of the boat, sleeping with his head on a pillow. The disciples woke him up. ‘Master,’ they shouted. ‘We will die! Do you not care?’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were graves in that place. As soon as Jesus came out of the boat, a man came from among the graves to meet him. The man had a bad spirit in him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The man lived among the graves. No person could tie him, not even with chains. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Many times people had tied him with strong ropes and chains. But he broke the chains and tore the ropes into many pieces. No person was strong enough to hold the man. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">All the time he stayed in the hills where the graves were. He screamed day and night and cut himself with sharp stones. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus was still far from him, but when he saw Jesus he ran to him. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He called out loud, ‘Jesus, Son of the High God, what are you going to do to me? I beg you not to hurt me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said this because Jesus had said to him, ‘You bad spirit, come out of the man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus asked, ‘What is your name?’ He answered, ‘My name is An Army, for we are many.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He begged Jesus saying, ‘Do not send us out of the country.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Many pigs were feeding on the hill there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The bad spirits begged Jesus saying, ‘Send us to the pigs so that we can go into them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus let them go right away. The bad spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. The pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water. The number of pigs was about two thousand. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the men who cared for the pigs ran away. They told the people in the city and all around the country about it. The people went out to see what had happened. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They came to Jesus. They saw the man who had the many bad spirits in him. He was sitting with clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man who used to have many bad spirits. And they told about the pigs. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the people began to beg Jesus to go away out of their country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So Jesus got into the boat again. The man who used to have the bad spirits in him begged to go with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Jesus did not let him. He said, ‘Go home. Tell your friends what the Lord has done for you. Tell them that he has helped you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the man went away and told people in the Ten Towns what Jesus had done for him. All the people were surprised. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus crossed over the sea again to the other side. Many people came to him while he was near the water. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">One of the rulers of the meeting house came to him. His name was Jairus. When he saw Jesus, he kneeled down before him. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Many doctors tried to heal her. She spent all the money she had to pay them. She was not better, but was getting worse. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When she heard of Jesus, she came among the people behind him. Then she reached out and touched his clothes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">She said to herself, ‘If only I touch his clothes, I will be well.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The bleeding stopped right away. She could feel that she was healed of her trouble. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus knew right away that power to heal went out from him. He turned around among the people and said, ‘Who touched my clothes?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But his disciples said to him, ‘You see all these people pushing around you. Why do you ask, “Who touched me?”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He looked around to see who had done it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The woman was afraid and trembled. She knew what had happened to her. She kneeled down in front of Jesus and told him the truth about herself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said to her, ‘Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled. You are healed.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">While Jesus was still talking, some people came from the ruler’s house. They said, ‘Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher any more?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus heard it. He said to the ruler, ‘Do not fear. Only believe.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus did not let anyone go with him only Peter, James, and his brother John. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They came to the ruler’s house. Jesus saw that there was trouble. People were crying and making much noise because the ruler’s daughter had died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When he came into the house, he said to them, ‘Why do you make so much noise and cry? The girl is not dead, but is sleeping.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They laughed at him. So he sent them all outside. Then he took the girl’s father and mother and the three disciples into the room where the girl was lying. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He took her hand and said, ‘Talitha cumi!’ That means, ‘Little girl, I tell you, get up!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The girl got up right away and walked around. She was twelve years old. The people were very much surprised. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Is he not the carpenter? Is not Mary his mother? Are not James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon his brothers? Are not his sisters here with us?’ The people did not understand Jesus. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">He called the twelve disciples to him and sent them out two by two. He gave them power to drive bad spirits out of people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said, ‘Take only a walking stick with you when you go. Do not take anything else. Do not take any food, or a bag, or money. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">The disciples went out and told the people that they should stop doing wrong things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They drove bad spirits out of many people. They also put oil on many sick people and healed them. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The Sabbath day was past. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome came to the grave. They brought spices that smelled very nice to put on the body of Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They came to the grave on the first day of the week. It was very early in the morning. The sun was beginning to shine. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">One woman said to the other, ‘Who will roll away the big stone from the grave for us?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The stone was very big. When they looked up they saw that the stone was rolled away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they went in the grave. They saw a young man dressed in a white gown. He sat at the right side. They were very much surprised. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said, ‘Do not be surprised. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was nailed to a cross. He is risen. He is not here. Look, here is where they laid him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Go and tell his disciples and Peter. Tell them he is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there as he said to you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then they left the grave quickly. They were trembling and afraid. They did not talk to anyone about it because they were afraid. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus rose early on the first day of the week. He showed himself first to Mary Magdalene. Jesus had driven seven bad spirits out of her. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">She went and told the disciples that she had seen him. They were still crying because Jesus was dead. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Mary told them that he was living. She had seen him. But they would not believe it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this, Jesus came to two disciples. He looked like a different person. They were walking out in the country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They went back and told the rest of the disciples, but they would not believe them either. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then after that Jesus showed himself to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He said it was very bad for them not to believe and for their minds to be slow. He said they should have believed those who saw him after he rose from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Jesus said to them, ‘Go into every part of the world. Tell the good news to everyone. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The one who believes the good news and is baptised will be saved. But he who does not believe will be judged and punished. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These signs will be with those who believe. They will drive bad spirits out of people by using my name. They will speak new languages. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They will take up snakes. If they drink poison, it will not make them sick. They will put their hands on sick people and sick people will get well again.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So after the Lord Jesus had talked to them, he went up into heaven and sat down beside God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then the disciples went and told the good news everywhere. The Lord worked with them. He made their words come true by the signs that happened after they talked.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Many people have tried already to write down the things that have happened among us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">These things were told us by men who saw them happen from the time they began to happen. And these men helped tell the good news. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I have tried to find out all that has happened from the beginning. And so, Theophilus, great ruler, I myself will write you the whole story. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then you will know that the things people have told you are true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He was one of a group of priests, and Abijah was their leader. Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth came from the family of Aaron. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Both of them were good people as God saw them. They obeyed all the laws and the things that the Lord said they should do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But they had no children. Elizabeth was not able to have a baby and they were both very old. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Zechariah was doing his work one day as a priest to God. It was time for his group to do the work in the temple. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The priests had a certain way of dividing their work. This day it was Zechariah’s turn to go into the temple of the Lord and burn the incense [that smells sweet when it is burned]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All the people were talking to God outside the temple at this time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">An angel of the Lord came to Zechariah. He was standing on the right side of the incense table. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Zechariah saw him, he was surprised and afraid. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the angel said, ‘Do not be afraid, Zechariah. You have been talking to God. He has heard you. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son. Name him John. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">‘You will be glad and happy. Many people will be glad when he is born. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He will be great in the way the Lord calls people great. He must not drink wine or any strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the time he is born. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He will go ahead of the Lord. He will have the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children. And he will bring back the people who do not obey, so that they will want to do what good people do. He will make people ready for the Lord.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Zechariah said to the angel, ‘How can I know that this will happen? I am an old man and my wife is also old.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The angel answered him, ‘I am Gabriel and I stand before God. I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now listen. You will be silent and not be able to talk until the day that all this has happened. This is because you did not believe what I told you. At the right time all that I said will come true.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the temple. They were surprised that he stayed in so long. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he came out, he could not talk to them. They knew that he had seen something in the temple. He made signs to them with his hands and did not talk. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When his time for doing the work of a priest was finished, Zechariah went home. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">After that, his wife Elizabeth found she was going to have a baby. For five months she stayed away from people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">She said to herself, ‘The Lord has done this for me. At this time he has remembered me so that I need not be ashamed among people anymore.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Elizabeth was now in her sixth month. God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The angel was sent to a young woman there. Her name was Mary. She was promised to a man named Joseph, to be his wife. He was of David’s family line. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The angel went into the house and said to her, ‘Be happy! God has blessed you more than other women. The Lord is with you!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">What the angel said troubled Mary. She wondered what this greeting meant. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary. God has blessed you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">You will have a baby son. Name him Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He will be a great man. He will be called the Son of the Highest One [a name for God]. The Lord God will make him king where his father David was king. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He will be king over the people of Israel for ever. He will never stop being king.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Mary said to the angel, ‘How can this happen? I have no husband.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The angel answered, ‘The Holy Spirit will come to you. The power of the Highest One will be over you. That is why the holy child who is to be born will be called the Son of God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">‘Your cousin Elizabeth is also going to have a baby son, though she is an old woman. This is the sixth month for her. She is one whom people said would not have a baby. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But God can do anything.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Mary said, ‘I am the Lord’s servant. Let it be as you have said.’ Then the angel left her. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">At that time, Mary got ready and went as quickly as she could to the hill country. She went to a town in Judah. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">She went into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby in her moved. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">She said in a loud voice, ‘God has made you happy and blessed you more than all other women. He has blessed your baby. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Listen! When I heard your greeting, the baby inside me moved because he was glad. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">She who has believed what was told her is blessed. What the Lord said to her will come true.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Mary said, ‘My heart is praising the Lord. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And my spirit is happy because God has saved me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He has remembered his servant even though she is not a great person. From now on all people of all times will say God has blessed me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">He who has all power has done a big work for me. His name is holy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">‘He is kind to people of all times who respect him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He has shown how strong he is with his arm. He has taken away people who were proud in their hearts. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He has moved big rulers from power, and those that were not great he has made great. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">He has given hungry people good things to eat, and sent away the rich people with nothing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">He has helped his servant Israel. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="56">Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months. Then she went home. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The time had now come for Elizabeth’s child to be born. She had a son. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">When her neighbours and family heard that the Lord had been so kind to her, they were glad, too. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">On the eighth day people came to circumcise [make a special mark on] the child. They were going to name him Zechariah like his father. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But his mother said, ‘No, his name is to be John.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">They said to her, ‘But no one in your family has that name.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">They made signs to the father to find out what name he wanted the child to have. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="64">Right then he opened his mouth and his tongue was free. He began to speak and to praise God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Everyone who lived around there began to wonder at these things. And everywhere in the hill country of Judea, all these things were talked about. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">All those who heard them thought much about them. They said, ‘What will this child be some day?’ They said this because the power of the Lord was with him. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="69">He has chosen one from the family of his servant David. He has given him power to save us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">That is what he promised through his holy prophets of God long ago. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Everyone went to his home town to have his name written in the book. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the town of Bethlehem in Judea. This was David’s town, and Joseph came from David’s family line. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He went to have his name written in the book. Joseph took Mary with him. She was promised to Joseph to be his wife. She was going to have a baby. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">While they were there, the time came for her baby to be born. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This was her first child, a son. She wrapped him in a cloth and laid him in a box where cows feed. There was no room for them in the house for strangers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In the same part of the country, men were taking care of sheep. They were in the field watching their sheep at night. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Simeon blessed them. He said to Mary, the mother of Jesus, ‘He will be a sign that people do not believe in. He will make many people in Israel fall and rise. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">Anna, a woman prophet of God, was there too. Her father’s name was Phanuel. She was of the tribe of Asher. She was very old. She had been married and lived with her husband for seven years. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">The devil took Jesus to a high place where he could see all the countries of the world at one time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to Jesus, ‘I will give you the right to rule over all these countries. They will make you great. All this has been given to me. I can give it to anyone I want. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So, if you worship and give honour to me, all will be yours.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered him, ‘The holy writings say, “You must worship the Lord your God and he is the only one you are to worship.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He put him on a high part of the temple. He said to him, ‘If you are God’s Son, jump down. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The holy writings say, “God will tell his angels to take care of you.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And “They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus answered him, ‘The holy writings say, “You must not test the Lord your God.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the devil finished all his testing, he left him for a while. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus had the power of the Spirit when he went back to Galilee. People talked about him in all that part of the country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He taught them in their meeting houses. All the people praised him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He went to Nazareth where he had grown up. He went to the meeting house as he always did on the Sabbath day. He stood up to read. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">A man gave him the book that Isaiah the prophet of God wrote long ago. He opened the book and found the place where it says, </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">‘The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he chose me to tell the good news to poor people. He has sent me to tell the prisoners they can go free, and to tell the blind people they can see. He has sent me to set free those who have been wrongly held down, </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and to tell people that the year when the Lord will help them has come.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jesus closed the book and gave it back to the man. He sat down. Everyone in the meeting house was watching him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He began to talk to them. He said, ‘You have heard what the holy writings say. They have come true today.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They all began to talk about him. They were surprised to hear him say such good words. They asked, ‘Is not this Joseph’s son?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus said, ‘I know that you will say this to me “Doctor, heal yourself. We have heard what you did in Capernaum. Do the same things here in your own country.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he went on to say, ‘I tell you the truth. No prophet of God is accepted by the people in his own country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">‘I tell you the truth. At the time of Elijah, there were many women in Israel whose husbands were dead. There was no rain for three years and six months. All over the country there was great trouble because there was no food. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Elijah was not sent to any of these widowed women in Israel. He was sent to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">‘Also while Elisha was the prophet of God, many people in Israel had leprosy [a bad skin disease]. None of them was healed. The only one who was healed was Naaman from the country of Syria.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When they heard this, all the people in the meeting house were very angry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They jumped to their feet and put Jesus out of the town. Their town was built on a hill. They took Jesus out to the top and wanted to throw him down the hill. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Jesus walked out between them and went away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went to the town of Capernaum in Galilee. He taught the people there on the Sabbath day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They were surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house. He called in a loud voice. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said, ‘Jesus from Nazareth! What do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us? I know who you are. You are God’s Holy Man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said to him, ‘Be quiet! Come out of him!’ The bad spirit threw the man down in front of them. He came out of the man and did not hurt him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">All the people were very much surprised. They said to each other, ‘What kind of talk is this? He can make bad spirits obey him. He tells them to come out and they come out.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The people in all the places around Capernaum heard about him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus left the meeting house and went to Simon’s house. The mother of Simon’s wife was sick with a bad fever. They asked Jesus to help her. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He went and stood beside her. He told the fever to leave her. It left. She got up right away and began to do things for them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When the sun went down, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick in any way. He put his hands on every one of them and healed them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The bad spirits also came out of many people. They called out, ‘You are the Son of God!’ But he stopped them. He would not let them talk because they knew that he was the Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The next morning Jesus went away to a place by himself. The people went to look for him. When they found him, they did not want him to leave them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But he said to them, ‘I must tell the good news to the people in other towns also. It is the news of God’s kingdom. I was sent to tell this.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So he told God’s word in the meeting houses in the Galilee area.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The people came close around Jesus to hear God’s word. He was standing by Lake Gennesaret [the Sea of Galilee]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He saw two boats by the water. The fishermen were not in their boats. They were washing their nets. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus got into one of the boats. It was Simon’s boat. Jesus asked him to put the boat out into the water a little way from the land. Then he sat down in the boat and taught the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When he stopped talking, he said to Simon, ‘Put the boat out into deep water and let down your nets to catch some fish.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Simon answered, ‘Master, we worked hard all night and did not catch anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they did this, they caught many fish. Their nets were so full they were breaking. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They called their friends in the other boat to come and help them. They came. They filled both boats with so much fish, they began to go down. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Simon Peter saw this, he kneeled down in front of Jesus. He said, ‘Lord, leave me because I am a bad man!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He was very much surprised to see how many fish they had caught. All those who were with him were surprised too. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were helping Simon. They were surprised also. Jesus said to Simon, ‘Do not fear. From now on your work will be to catch men.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They brought their boats to the land. Then they left everything and went with Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus was in one of the cities and a man was there who had leprosy, a bad skin disease. When he saw Jesus, he bowed his face to the ground. He begged Jesus saying, ‘Sir, I know you can heal me if you want to.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus put out his hand and touched the man. He said, ‘I want you to be healed.’ Right away the man was free from leprosy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus said to him, ‘Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you. Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed. Give it to prove to the people that you are healed.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But more people heard about Jesus than before. And many people gathered to hear him, and so be healed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Many times Jesus went away to the desert and talked with God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">One day Jesus was teaching people. Pharisees and other Jewish teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every town in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem. Jesus had the power of the Lord to heal the sick. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Some men brought a sick man on his bed. The man could not move his arms or legs. They tried to bring him in and put him in front of Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. Then through a hole in the roof they let down the bed with the sick man on it, until he was in front of Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to him, ‘Man, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The scribes and Pharisees began to talk about this. They said, ‘Who is this man that is not giving respect to God? No one but God can forgive anyone for the wrong things they have done.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, ‘Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Which is easier, to say, “The wrong things you have done are forgiven,” or to say, “Get up and walk”? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done.’ So he said to the sick man, ‘I tell you, get up. Take up your bed and go home.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his bed and went home praising God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The people were all surprised and they praised God. They did not know what to think. They said, ‘We have seen things today that are hard to believe.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After this, Jesus went out. He saw a tax collector named Levi. Levi was sitting at the place where people came to pay taxes. Jesus said to him ‘Come with me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Levi left everything. He stood up and went with Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Levi made a big dinner at his house for Jesus. Many tax collectors and other people were sitting at the table with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The Pharisees and their scribes did not like what Jesus’ disciples did. They said, ‘Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and bad people?” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus answered them, ‘People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They said to him, ‘The disciples or followers of John are often fasting [not eating for a time], and they talk with God. The disciples of the Pharisees do the same. But your disciples eat and drink.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Jesus said to them, ‘The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will be fasting at that time.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus told them a short story. He said, ‘No one takes a piece from a new coat and sews it on an old coat. If he does, the new coat will have a hole. And the new piece will not be like the old coat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">No one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins. The wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">New wine must be put into new skins. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">No one wants to drink new wine after he has had old wine. He says, “The old is better.”’      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus was walking through the grain fields on a Sabbath day. His disciples picked some of the grain as they went along. They cleaned it by rubbing it in their hands, and ate it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Some of the Pharisees said, ‘Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered them, ‘Have you not read what David did? He and his men were hungry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He went into God’s house. Some bread was there for God. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the men who were with him. Only the priests have the right to eat that bread.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said to them, ‘The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">On another Sabbath day, Jesus went into the meeting house and taught. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, ‘Come and stand here in front’ The man stood up. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to them, ‘I ask you, is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day, or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so that they will live, or to let them die?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He looked around at them all. Then he said to the man, ‘Hold out your hand.’ The man did so and it was made well like the other hand. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisees were very angry and they talked together about what they could do to Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">About that time Jesus went out of the city on the hill to talk with God. He talked with God all night. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In the morning he called his disciples to him. He chose twelve of them and called them apostles [special messengers]. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus came down the hill with them and stood on the flat ground. Many people came. There were many of his disciples.

      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to him, ‘Simon, I have something to say to you.’ And he said, ‘Teacher, say it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said, ‘There was a man who used to lend money to people. Two people owed him money. One man owed him five hundred pieces of silver money. The other owed him fifty pieces. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They could not pay the money, so he let them both free. Now which one of them will love him more?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Simon answered, ‘I would say the one he let off the most.’ Jesus said, ‘You are right.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he turned towards the woman. He said to Simon, ‘Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me water to wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Soon after this, Jesus went through the cities and towns. He told the people God’s word about the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve disciples were with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Some women were also with him. They had bad spirits and had been sick. But they had been healed. One was Mary, called Magdalene. Seven bad spirits had gone out of her. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Another one was Joanna, the wife of Chuza, who worked for Herod. Another one was Susanna. And there were many others who gave what they could to help him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Many people came to him from many towns. Then he told them a story. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said, ‘A man went out to sow his seed. As he sowed it, some seed fell on the road. People stepped on the seed. Birds ate it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Some seed fell on the stony ground. It grew but soon died because the place was too dry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But some seed fell on good ground and it grew well. Those plants gave a hundred times as much grain as the man sowed.’ When Jesus had said this, he called out, ‘Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">His disciples asked Jesus what this story meant. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to them, ‘You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But other people must have stories. They will look, but they will not see. They will hear, but they will not understand.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">‘Now here is what the story means. The seed is God’s word. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Some seeds fell on the road. They are like the people who hear the word of God. Then the devil comes and takes the word out of their hearts. He does not want them to believe and be saved. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Some seeds fell on the stones. They are like people who are glad when they hear the word. But it does not go down deep into their hearts. They believe for a short time. But when they have trouble they stop believing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Some seeds fell among the weeds. They are like people who hear the word. But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and things to be happy in this life. As they go on in life, these things push the message out of their hearts and no good comes from them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Some seeds fell on good ground. They are like people who hear the word and remember it. Their hearts are honest and good. These people keep on believing, and much good comes from them.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples. He said to them, ‘Let us cross over to the other side of the sea.’ So they started out. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">While they were going, Jesus was sleeping. A bad storm came on the sea. Water was coming into the boat, and they were in trouble. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The disciples came to Jesus and woke him. They shouted, ‘Master! Master! We will die!’ Jesus woke and said to the wind and the water, ‘Stop!’ They stopped. Then all was quiet </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to the disciples, ‘Why do you not believe God?’ They were afraid and surprised. They said to each other, ‘What kind of man is this? He tells the wind and the sea what to do and they obey him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people. Their country is on the other side of the sea from Galilee. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As Jesus got out of the boat a man met him from the town. He had bad spirits in him. He had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house, but among the graves. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he saw Jesus, he screamed loudly and bowed down in front of him. He called out loud, ‘Jesus, Son of the Highest One! What do you want to do to me? I beg you, do not hurt me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He said this because Jesus had told the bad spirit to come out of the man. Many times the spirit had taken hold of the man. People had guarded him. They had tied him with chains and strong ropes. But he broke the chains and ropes. The bad spirit drove him into the desert. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus asked him, ‘What is your name?’ He answered, ‘My name is An Army.’ He said this because many bad spirits had gone into him. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">All the people in the country around the Gadarenes asked Jesus to go away from them to some other place. They were very much afraid. So Jesus got into a boat and went back. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">He said, ‘Go home and tell the people what God has done for you.’ So the man went away and told the people all through the town what Jesus had done for him. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But the people found out and they followed him. He was glad to see them and talked to them about God’s kingdom. He healed those who were sick. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When it was late in the day, the twelve disciples came to him. They said, ‘Send the people away so they can go to the towns and the farms to sleep and get something to eat. This is a lonely place.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to them, ‘Do not tell this to anyone.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then he went on to say, ‘The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. On the third day he will be raised from death.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And He said to all the people, ‘If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. Every day he must take up his cross [be ready to die] and come with me. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">About eight days after saying these things, Jesus went up on a hill to talk with God. He took Peter, John, and James with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As he was talking with God, he was changed. His face was different. His clothes became very white and shining. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And then two men were talking with Jesus. They were Moses and Elijah. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Light was shining from them. They talked about his leaving this world. That would happen when he was in Jerusalem. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">When the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, ‘Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ Peter did not know what he was saying. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">As he said this, a cloud came over them. They were very much afraid when the cloud came around them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A voice in the cloud said, ‘This is my dear Son. Listen to him!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The talking stopped. Then Jesus was left alone. The disciples did not say anything. They did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The next day they came down the hill. Many people met him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">One man among them called out, ‘Teacher, I beg you, look at my son. He is my only child. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said, ‘You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">While he was coming, the bad spirit knocked him down and threw him around. Jesus told the spirit to stop. He healed the boy and gave him back to his father. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">All the people were surprised to see that God has so much power. While the people were wondering about everything Jesus did, he talked to his disciples. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He said, ‘Listen well to what I say. The Son of Man will be given over to men,’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they did not understand what he said. The meaning was hidden from them so they would not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The disciples started talking among themselves. They quarrelled about which of them was the greatest person. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a child and put him by his side. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then he said, ‘If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. And if anyone takes in me, he takes in the one who sent me. The one who takes the least or lowest place among you is the greatest.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">John answered, ‘Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name. We told him to stop because he is not one of us.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="55">But he turned and said to them, ‘Stop that! You do not think about what kind of spirit you are showing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The Son of Man did not come to kill people, but to save them.’ And they went on to another town. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">As they went along on the road, a man said to him, ‘I will go anywhere you go.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said, ‘Foxes have holes to live in. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He wanted to see who Jesus was but he could not see him because he was a short man and there were many people around him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he ran ahead and climbed into a tree to see Jesus, for he was coming that way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up. He said, ‘Zacchaeus, come down right now. I must stay at your house today.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Zacchaeus came down right then. He was glad to have Jesus come in his house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When all the people saw this, they did not like it. They said, ‘He has gone to visit a bad man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, ‘Look, Lord, I will give to the poor people half of all I have. And if I have cheated anyone, I will give him back four times as much as I took.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to him, ‘The head of this house has been saved today! He also is a son of Abraham. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Son of Man came to look for and to save those who are lost.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">While they were listening to this, he started to tell them a story. He did so because they were near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God would begin right away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So he said, ‘A man who belonged to a respected family went to a country far away. He went to get power to rule. Then he was going to come back. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Before he left, he called ten of his servants. He gave each of them some money. He said, “Go and trade with this money until I come back.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">‘His people hated him. They chose some men and sent them after him to tell the king, “We do not want this man to rule over us.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But he was given the power to rule and came back. Then he called the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much money each one had made by trading. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The first one came to him and said, “Sir, your money has made ten times more money.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">‘The ruler said, “You have done well. You are a good servant. You will rule over ten cities because you have done well with a very small thing.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The second one came to him and said, “Sir, your money has made five times more money.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The ruler said, “You will rule over five cities.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">‘Then another servant came and said, “Sir, here is your money. I hid it in a cloth and kept it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You take in where you put nothing out. You gather where you did not plant.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">‘The ruler said “You bad servant! I will judge you by your own words. You knew that I was a hard man! You knew that I take in where I put nothing out. You knew that I gather where I did not plant. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Why did you not put my money in the bank? Then when you came home I would have had my money with interest.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">‘Some men were standing there. He said to them, “Take the money from him. Give it to the man who has ten times as much.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They said, “Sir, he has ten times as much already!” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The ruler said, “I tell you. Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But where are those people who hate me and did not want me to rule over them? Bring them here and kill them right here in front of me.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When Jesus had said this, he went on ahead of them towards Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He came near Bethphage and Bethany by the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then he sent two of his disciples ahead. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He said, ‘Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find an animal tied up. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it and bring it to me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If anyone asks you, “Why are you untying it?” tell him, “The Lord needs it.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They went and found it just as Jesus had said. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When they were untying the animal, the men who owned it asked them, ‘Why are you untying the animal?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They said, ‘The Lord needs it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it. Then they put Jesus on it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As he was riding along, people spread their coats on the road. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He came near the top of the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then all the people who believed in him began to be happy. They sang out loudly, and praised God in a loud voice for all the big works they had seen. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They said, ‘God bless the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven where God is praised!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Some of the Pharisees who were among the people said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, tell your disciples to stop saying that.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus answered, ‘I tell you, if they do not speak like this the stones will call out.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When Jesus came near, he saw the city. His heart was very sad and he cried. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He said, ‘I wish you knew today what things would give you peace! But now you do not see what they are. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The time will come when the people who hate you will put a wall all around you. They will shut you up and keep you in on every side. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">They will break you down to the ground. They will kill the people within you. They will not leave one stone of your houses on top of another. That will happen because you did not know the time when God was ready to help you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said to them, ‘It is written, “My house shall be a place where people talk with God.” But you have made it a place for people who steal!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">He taught in the temple every day. The chief priests, scribes and the leaders of the people wanted to kill him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But they did not find any way they could do it. All the people stayed around to hear what Jesus said.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple. He was telling them God’s good news. The chief priests and the scribes came to him with the leaders. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They said to him, ‘Tell us what right you have to do these things. Who gave you the right to do them?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He answered, ‘I will ask you a question also. Tell me this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men give it to him?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They talked it over together. They said, ‘If we say, “God gave John the right to do it,” he will say, “Then why did you not believe him?” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we say, “Men gave him the right to do it,” then the people will kill us with stones. They believe that John was a prophet of God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they answered Jesus, ‘We do not know who gave him the right to do it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesus said to them, ‘Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus began to tell the people this story. ‘A man planted a farm. He let some men use the farm. They paid him money for the rent. Then he went to a country far away and stayed a long time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">‘At harvest time the owner sent one of his servants to the men who used the farm. He wanted to have some fruit from the farm. But the men beat the servant and sent him away without any fruit. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he sent another servant. They beat this one also, and did wrong things to him. And they sent him away without any fruit. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He sent a servant the third time. They hurt this one also and threw him out of the farm. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">‘Then the man who owned the farm said, “What shall I do? I will send my dear son. Maybe they will respect him.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">‘But when the men saw him they said to each other, “This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him. Then everything will belong to us.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They dragged him off the farm and killed him. ‘What will the man who owned the farm do to them? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will come back and kill those men. And he will give the farm to other men to use.’ When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they said, ‘May it not be so!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">‘But Jesus looked right at them. He said, ‘What about this writing then? “The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But if that stone falls on anyone, it will crush him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The scribes and the chief priests wanted to catch Jesus right then but they feared the people. They understood that he had told this story against them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So they watched for a chance to catch him. And they sent men to spy on him. These men acted as if they were good men. They did this because they wanted to catch him in something that he said. They wanted to give him over to the ruler who would judge and punish him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they asked Jesus, ‘Teacher, we know that you talk and teach what is right. You do not fear any person. But you teach the true way of God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it right to pay money as taxes to Caesar or is it not?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He knew they were trying to get him into trouble. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he said, ‘Show me a piece of money. Whose picture and name are on it?’ They said, ‘Caesar’s’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then he said to them, ‘So give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They were not able to catch him in anything he said in front of the people. They were surprised at his answer and they could not say anything. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. (They say that people do not rise from death.) </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They came to ask Jesus a question. ‘Teacher,’ they said, ‘Moses gave us this law: “If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There were seven brothers. The first one married. He died and left no children. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The second one married the wife. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the third one married her. All seven brothers married her. They all had no children and they died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Last of all, the woman died also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now then, when people rise from death, whose wife will she be? All seven of them had married her.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to them, ‘Men and women in this world marry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But men and women who are good enough to have a place in the next world and to be raised from death do not marry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">They cannot die again. They are like angels. They are God’s children because they have been raised from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Even Moses showed that people do rise from death. It is in his book where we read about the small tree which burned. Moses says that the Lord is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He is not the God of dead people, but of living people. All people are alive to him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Some of the scribes said to him, ‘Teacher, what you say is right.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">After that, people were afraid to ask him any more questions. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But Jesus asked them, ‘How can people say that Christ is David’s son? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (42-43) </STYLE>David himself says in the book of the Psalms, “The Lord said to my Lord, sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be David’s son?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then Jesus talked to his disciples while all the people could hear him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said, ‘Take care. Do not let the scribes fool you. They like to walk about dressed in long gowns. They want people to greet them in the market. They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses. They want to sit in the best places at feasts. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. They cover up their wrong ways by talking to God a long time. They will be punished more!’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus looked around in the temple. He saw the place where the people put in their money. Rich people were putting in their money. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he saw a poor woman whose husband was dead. She put in two small pieces of money. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus said, ‘I tell you the truth. This poor woman has given more than all the other people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it. She was poor and she gave everything she had. She has nothing left to live on.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some people were talking about how nice the temple looked. They talked about the fine stones and the things people gave to make the temple. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said, ‘You see these things. Not one stone here will be left on top of another. They will all be thrown down!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They asked him, ‘Teacher, when will this happen? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said, ‘Take care. Do not let anyone fool you. Many men will come in my name. They will say, “I am Christ.” And they will say, “The time is now.” Do not go after them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When you hear about wars and fighting, do not fear. These things must happen first, but it is not the end right away.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then he said, ‘One tribe will fight against another tribe. And one country will fight against another country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In some places the earth will shake very much. In many places the people will have no food to eat. And many people will be sick. There will be things to make people fear. There will be big signs in the sky. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">‘But before all these things happen, people will catch you and trouble you. They will take you to the meeting houses to be judged. They will put you in prison. They will take you to kings and rulers because you are true to me. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It was near the time for the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. This is called the Passover Feast. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The chief priests and the scribes planned how to kill Jesus. But they feared the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Satan came into the heart of Judas. Judas was one of the twelve disciples. His other name was Iscariot. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">They were glad, and they said they would give him money for it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He agreed. He watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus when there were not too many people around. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It was the day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast, </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying to them, ‘Go and get the Passover Feast ready for us to eat.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They asked, ‘Where do you want us to get it ready?’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">The disciples said, ‘Look, Lord, here are two swords.’ And he answered, ‘That is enough.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then Jesus went out of the room and went to the hill called the Mount of Olives where he often went. His disciples went with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He said to them, ‘Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He went away from them about as far as a person can throw a stone. Then he kneeled down to talk with God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He said, ‘Father, if you will, take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want but what you want.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then an angel came to him from heaven and helped to make him strong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">His heart was troubled very much. So he talked with God more than before. His sweat was like big drops of blood falling on the ground. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">He stopped talking with God and got up. He went to his disciples and found them sleeping because they were sad. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said to them, ‘Why are you sleeping? Get up. Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">As Jesus was saying this, many men came. One of the twelve disciples, named Judas, was leading the people. He came near Jesus to kiss him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to him, ‘Judas, will you give over the Son of Man to his enemies with a kiss?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The disciples around Jesus saw what was going to happen. They said, ‘Lord, shall we fight with our swords?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">One of them hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said, ‘Just let me do this.’ And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the leaders of the people had come to catch Jesus. He said to them, ‘Have you come to take me with swords and sticks, the way you catch a man who steals? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">I was with you every day in the temple. You did not try to catch me then. But this is your time now, the time of the power of darkness.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">The men caught Jesus and took him away to the high priest’s house. Peter followed them far behind. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">They made a fire in the yard and sat around it. Peter sat down with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">A woman saw Peter sitting by the fire. She looked at him and said, ‘This man was with him also.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But Peter said, ‘Woman, I do not know him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">After a while, another person saw him and said, ‘You are one of them also.’ But Peter said, ‘Man, I am not.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">About an hour later another person said, ‘Surely this man was with him. He comes from Galilee.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Peter said, ‘Man, I do not know what you are talking about.’ And right then, while he was talking, the cock called. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="62">Peter went out and cried very much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">The men who guarded Jesus made fun of him and beat him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">They tied something over his eyes. Then they hit him in the face and said, ‘Tell us if you know who hit you!’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="66">In the morning the leaders of the people, the chief priests and scribes met together. They took Jesus to their court. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then all the people got up and took Jesus to Pilate. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They began to make a complaint against him. They said, ‘This man is leading our people to do wrong. He says we should not pay taxes to Caesar. He says that he is Christ, a King.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Pilate asked Jesus, ‘Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered, ‘Yes, I am.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, ‘I find nothing wrong in this man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said all the more, ‘He troubles the people by his teaching. He has been teaching people in all the country of Judea. He began in Galilee and has come as far as this city.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Pilate heard this, he asked, ‘Is this man from Galilee?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he knew that he came from Herod’s country, he sent him to Herod. Herod was in Jerusalem at that time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was glad to see Jesus. He had heard about him. And he had wanted to see him for a long time. He was hoping that he would see Jesus do a big work. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He asked Jesus many questions. But Jesus did not answer him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The chief priests and the scribes stood near. They brought strong complaints against him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Herod and his soldiers laughed at Jesus and made fun of him. He dressed him up in very fine clothes and sent him back to Pilate. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that, they had hated each other. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate then called the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said to them, ‘You brought this man to me. You said he is leading your people to do wrong. I have asked questions here in front of you. I have found nothing wrong in this man. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Herod did the same. He sent him back to us. This man has done nothing for which he should die. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I will beat him and let him go.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">At the feast Pilate always let one man go free. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they all shouted, ‘Kill this man! Let Barabbas go free for us!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(Barabbas had been put in prison because he led some people who had been fighting in the city. He had killed a man.) </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate talked to the people again. He wanted to let Jesus go free. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they shouted, ‘Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them the third time, ‘Why, what wrong thing has he done? I have not found any wrong thing for which he should die. So I will beat him and let him go.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they shouted all the more loudly, saying, ‘Nail him to a cross!’ And Pilate gave in to their shouting. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he said they could have it their way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He let the other man go free. (He was the one who had been put in prison because he fought and had killed a man. He was the one the people asked Pilate to let go free.) And Pilate did to Jesus what they wanted him to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They took Jesus away. On the way, they caught a man who was coming in from the farms. His name was Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him walk behind Jesus and carry his cross. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Many people followed him. Women cried and were sorry for him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Jesus turned to them and said, ‘Daughters of Jerusalem, do not cry for me. But cry for yourselves and for your children. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The time will come when people will say, “Happy are the women who have no children or who have never had a child.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then people will begin to say to the big hills, “Fall on us.” They will say to the small hills, “Hide us.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If this is what people do when the wood is new, what will they do when it is old?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Two men were also led away to be killed with Jesus. They were bad men. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They came to the place called Calvary (the head bone.) There they nailed the two bad men to the crosses also. They put one man on the right side of Jesus and one man on the left side of him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them! They do not know what they are doing.’ The soldiers played a game to see how they should divide his clothes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The people stood around watching. But the rulers made fun of him. They said, ‘He saved other people. He should save himself if he is God’s Christ, God’s chosen one!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The soldiers made fun of him. They came and brought him wine to drink. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They said, ‘If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The sign that was put above Jesus’ head said, ‘This is the King of the Jews.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">One of the bad men who was hanging there said wrong things against Jesus. He said ‘If you are the Christ, why do you not save yourself and us?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other bad man told him to stop. He said, ‘Do you not even fear God? You are being punished just as he is. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">It is right for us to be punished because we have done wrong things. But this man has done nothing bad.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He said to Jesus, ‘Lord, remember me when you become a King.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said to him, ‘I tell you the truth. Today you will be with me in God’s garden of paradise.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">About noontime the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The sun did not shine. The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Jesus called out loud, ‘Father, I put my spirit into your hands!’ When he had said this, he died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The captain saw all this. Then he praised God. He said, ‘Surely, this was a good man!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Many people were around there to look on. When they saw what happened, they all went home beating their chests [because they were sad]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">All Jesus’ friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood far away. They saw all of this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">There was a man named Joseph. He was a member of the court. He was a good man who lived the right way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He had not wanted the people to do what they did. He was looking for the kingdom of God. He was from a town of the Jews, called Arimathea. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">He took the body down from the cross. He wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a grave cut in a rock. No one had ever been put in this grave. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">It was the day before the Sabbath. And it was almost time for the Sabbath to begin. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Some women had come with Jesus from Galilee. They followed and saw the grave where his body was put. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then they went back and got things ready to put on his body. These things were spices that smelled very nice, and sweet kinds of oil. On the Sabbath day they rested as the law said they should.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On the first day of the week, early in the morning, the women went to the grave. They took with them the things they had made ready. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They saw that the stone was rolled away from the grave. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So they went in. But they did not see the body of the Lord Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They were troubled about this. Then they saw two men standing near them. They were dressed in white clothes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The women were afraid and bowed their faces down to the ground. The men said to them, ‘Why do you look for a living person among dead people? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here. He has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said that the Son of Man would be given over to bad men. He would be nailed to a cross, and he would rise on the third day.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then they remembered what he had said. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They left the grave and went back. They told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the other people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The women who told these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Peter got up and ran to the grave. He bowed down and looked in. He saw the linen clothes lying there, but nothing more. Then he left, wondering about what had happened. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">That same day, two of the disciples were going to the town called Emmaus. It was about two hours walk from Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They were talking together about all the things that had happened. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While they were talking and asking each other questions, Jesus himself came and walked with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But even though they saw him, they did not know who he was. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus asked them, ‘What is this that you are talking about as you walk along looking so sad?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">One of them named Cleophas answered him. He said, ‘Are you a stranger in Jerusalem and do not know what has happened there these last days?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said, ‘What things?” They said, ‘All that has happened to Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet of God. He had power to do big works and to teach the people. He was respected by God and all the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our chief priests and rulers gave him over to be punished by death, and they nailed him to a cross. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we were hoping that he was the one who would free the people of Israel. But that is not all. This is the third day since they did it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Some of our women told us things that surprised us. Early this morning they were at the grave. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They did not find his body there. They came back and said that they saw angels. The angels told them that Jesus was living. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some of us went to the grave. And they found everything just as the women said. But they did not see Jesus.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then he said to them, ‘You foolish men! Your hearts are slow to believe all that the prophets of God have said long ago. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Christ had to have this trouble and go to the place where he will be great, did he not?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he told them the meaning of all that Moses and all the prophets of God long ago had written about him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They came near the village to which they were going. It looked as if he was going on further. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But they begged him not to go further. They said, ‘Stay with us. It will soon be night. The day is almost finished.’ So he went in to stay with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He sat down at the table with them. Then he took the bread and thanked God for it. He broke it and gave it to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then they saw who he was. They knew him. And then suddenly they could not see him any more. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They said to each other, ‘It was like a fire burning in our hearts when he talked to us on the road and told us the meaning of the holy writings!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They got up right then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples together. Some other people were with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">These people said, ‘The Lord has really risen! He came to Simon!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then the men from Emmaus told them what had happened on the road. They told how they knew Jesus when he broke bread and gave it to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">While they were telling them this, Jesus himself stood there with them. He said to them, ‘Peace to you!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They were troubled and afraid. They thought they were seeing a spirit. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, ‘Why are you troubled? Why do you wonder about these things in your hearts? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Look at my hands and my feet. You can see that it is I myself. Touch me with your hands and see. A spirit does not have a body and bones as you see I have.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They were very happy and surprised and still found it hard to believe. Then Jesus said, ‘Do you have anything to eat?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They gave him a piece of cooked fish. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He took the fish and ate it in front of them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he said, ‘I told you this while I was with you. I told you that things were written about me in the books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. And I told you that all of these things must come true.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he taught them so that they understood the things in the holy writings. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said, ‘It is written that the Christ must have trouble. On the third day he will rise from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Men will talk in his name to people in all countries. They will tell them to stop their wrong ways and ask to be forgiven. They will begin in Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">You are the men who have seen these things, and will tell people about them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">I will send you what the Father has promised to give you. So wait in the city of Jerusalem until you have been given power from God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus led the disciples out as far as the town of Bethany. He put up his hands and blessed them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">While he was blessing them, he left them. He was taken up into heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">They bowed down and worshipped him. They were very happy and went back to Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Every day they were in the temple praising God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">The Light shone where it was dark and the darkness did not stop the Light from shining. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God sent a man named John. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He came to talk about the Light, so that all people might believe in the Light by what he said. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He himself was not that Light, but he was sent to talk about the Light. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true Light which gives light to every person who comes into the world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He, the Word, was in the world. Yes, he even made the world. And yet the world did not know him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came into the world that was his own, but his own people did not receive him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But there were people who did believe in his name. They did receive him. He gave all those who received him and believed him the right to become children of God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They were born into God’s family by God. That is, they were not born into his family in the way a person is born into this world. It was not by any person’s will. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Word became man and he lived among us. We saw with our own eyes that he is great. He is great the way God the Father made his only Son great. We saw that he is full of loving kindness and truth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John talked about him. He called out saying, ‘Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He was full of loving kindness, and we have all received so much kindness from him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moses gave the law, but Jesus Christ gave this loving kindness and truth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one has ever seen God. But his only Son is very near to his Father’s heart. He has told us plainly about God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The leaders of the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked John, ‘Who are you?’ John told them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He did not hide the truth, but he told people plainly. He said, ‘I am not the Christ.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they asked him, ‘Well then, are you Elijah?’ He answered, ‘No, I am not.’ They asked, ‘Are you the Prophet?’ He answered, ‘No.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then those priests said, ‘Who are you? We want to give an answer to the people who sent us. What do you say about yourself?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">John said, ‘I am a voice calling in the desert, “Make the road straight for the Lord.” This is what was said by Isaiah, the prophet of God long ago.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">It was the Pharisees who had sent these people to John. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So they asked him, ‘If you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why then are you baptizing?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered, ‘I baptize people in water. But there is a man standing among you whom you do not know. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He is the one coming after me who is greater than I am. I am not even good enough to untie his shoe strings.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The place where John was baptizing was Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John saw Jesus coming to him. ‘Look,’ said John. ‘See God’s special Lamb! He takes away the wrong ways of the world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I myself did not know who he was. But I came and baptized people in water so that the people of Israel would know who he was.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">John also said, ‘I saw the Spirit coming from the sky. He came down on him like a dove. It stayed on him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I myself did not know who he was. But he who sent me to baptize people in water told me. He said, “You will see the Spirit coming from the sky on a man. That man will baptize people in the Holy Spirit.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I saw the Spirit coming on him, and I have told you. This man is the Son of God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The next day, John was standing with two of his followers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus walked by. When John saw him, he said, ‘Look, see God’s Lamb!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The two followers heard what John said, so they went after Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus turned. He saw them coming after him. He said to them, ‘What are you looking for?’ They said, ‘Teacher, where do you live?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, ‘Come and see.’ They went and saw the place where Jesus was staying. The time was about four o’clock in the afternoon. They stayed with Jesus the rest of the day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Andrew was one of those two followers of John who heard John speak and went after Jesus. He was Simon Peter’s brother. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The first thing Andrew did then was to find his brother Simon. He said, ‘We have found the Messiah!’ (Messiah means the Christ, the messenger of God.) </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, ‘You are Simon, the son of John. Your name will be Cephas.’ (Cephas means Peter, a rock or stone.) </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The next day Jesus said, ‘I will go to Galilee.’ He found Philip and said to him, ‘Come with me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Philip was from the town of Bethsaida. Andrew and Peter were also from that town. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip went to find Nathanael. He said ‘We have found the man about whom Moses wrote in the books of the law. The prophets also wrote about him. He is Jesus, from Nazareth. He is the son of Joseph.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael said, ‘From Nazareth? Can any good thing come from there?’ Philip said, ‘Come and see for yourself.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said, ‘Here is a man who is truly of Israel. He does not fool people.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael asked, ‘How do you know me?’ Jesus answered, ‘I saw you when you were under the fig tree. That was before Philip called you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael said, ‘Teacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered, ‘I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. Is that why you believe in me now? You will see more wonderful things than that! </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in the country of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother said to the servants, ‘Do all that he tells you to do.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Six very large water pots made of stone were standing there. The pots were there because the Jews had a certain law about washing themselves. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said, ‘Fill the pots with water.’ So they filled them to the very top. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said, ‘Now take some out. Carry it to the one in charge of the feast.’ They did what he said. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The man in charge of the feast tasted the water that was now turned into wine. He did not know where it came from, but the servants who drew the water knew. When the man had tasted it, he called the man who was being married. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, ‘Other people give the good wine at the beginning of the feast. When people have had all they want, then they give the wine which is not so good. But you have kept the good wine until now.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This was the first big work that Jesus did. It was in Cana in Galilee. He showed that he was great. And his disciples believed in him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went to the town called Capernaum. His mother, his brothers, and his disciples also went with him. They stayed there for a few days. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. So Jesus went to Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the temple he found people buying and selling things. They were selling cows, sheep, and doves. Others were sitting at tables changing money for the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus tied some pieces of cord together to make a whip. Then he drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. And he drove out the sheep and the cows. He threw down the tables of the money changers and their money. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said to the people who sold doves, ‘Take these things out of here. Do not make my Father’s house into a market place.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">His disciples remembered that God’s word says, ‘My love for your house is like a fire burning in me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The leaders of the Jews said to Jesus, ‘Who gave you the right to do this? What big work will prove it to us?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered them, ‘Break down this temple and in three days I will raise it up.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jewish leaders said, ‘It took forty-six years to build this temple. Do you say you will raise it in three days?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Jesus was talking about the temple which was his body. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After Jesus died and had been raised from death, the disciples remembered that he had said this to them. Then they believed what the holy writings say. They also believed what Jesus had said to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Many people believed in Jesus’ name when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast. They believed in him because they saw the big works he did. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus would not trust himself to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He knew what all people are like. He did not need anyone to tell him about any person, because he knew what was in a person’s heart.      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">One night Nicodemus came to Jesus. He said, ‘Master, we know you are a teacher sent by God. We know this because no person could do the big works you are doing if God did not help him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus said, ‘I tell you the truth. No person can see God’s kingdom if he is not born again.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said, ‘How can a man be born when he is old? Can he go inside of his mother again and be born?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said, ‘I tell you the truth. This new birth is by water and by the Spirit. No person can enter God’s kingdom if he has not been born that way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of a person is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The Pharisees heard that Jesus was getting people to follow him and was baptizing them. (Jesus’ disciples baptized them, not he himself.) He now had more followers than John. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Many sick people were lying on these places. Some of them were blind. Some were lame. Some were very thin and stiff so that they could not move by themselves. All of them were waiting for the water to move. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">An angel came down into the water at a certain time and made it move. The first person who stepped into the water when it moved was healed of any sickness that he had. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A man was there who had been sick for thirty eight years. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man said to him, ‘Sir, I have no man to put me into the water when it moves. While I am trying to get in, some other person comes and gets in before me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said, ‘Get up. Take up your bed and walk!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The man was healed right away. He took up his bed and walked. This happened on the Sabbath day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the leaders of the Jews talked to the man who was healed. They said, ‘It is the Sabbath day. It is not right for you to carry your bed.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, ‘My Father is still working and I am working also.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This was why the leaders of the Jews tried much more to kill Jesus. He had broken the law of the Sabbath day. And also he called God his Father. In that way, he was making himself equal with God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to them, ‘l tell you the truth. The Son cannot do anything alone. He sees what his Father is doing and he does the same. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">When the people heard what he said, they went out, one by one. The oldest one went out first. Jesus was left alone with the woman in front of him. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">That is why the parents said, ‘He is old enough to talk for himself. Ask him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then again they called the man who had been blind. They said to him, ‘You must praise God for this. We know that the man who healed you is a bad man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered them, ‘I do not know if he is a bad man or not. But one thing I do know. I know that first I was blind, but now I can see.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then they said to him again, ‘What did he do to you? How did he heal you?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered them, ‘I told you already. You did not listen. Why do you want me to tell you again? Do you also want to be his disciples?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This made them angry. They said, ‘You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We know that God talked to Moses. But this man, we do not know where he comes from.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man who had been blind said, ‘This surprises me! He healed me and yet you do not know where he comes from! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">We know that God does not listen to bad people. But God listens to the person who shows him respect and who obeys him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Before this, no one has ever healed a man who was born blind. Such a thing has not been heard of since the world was made. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If this man did not come from God, he could not do anything like this.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They answered, ‘You have been a bad man ever since you were born! Now are you trying to teach us?’ And with that they put him out of the meeting place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that the people had put him out. When he found him, he said, ‘Do you believe in the Son of God?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He answered, ‘Sir, who is the Son of God? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said, ‘You have already seen him. The person who is talking to you now, he is the Son of God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The man said, ‘Sir, I do believe.’ He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, ‘I came into the world so that people may be judged. I came so that those who are blind may see. And I came so that those who see may become blind.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Some of the Pharisees were with Jesus and heard him say this. They asked him, ‘You mean to say that we are blind also?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus answered them, ‘If you agreed that you were blind, you would not be bad people. But you say, “We can see.” So then you are still bad people.’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus went on to say, ‘I tell you the truth. A person must get to the sheep through the door. Anyone who climbs over the wall to get in is a bad man and steals things. He has come to steal the sheep. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the man who comes in through the door, he is the one who takes care of the sheep. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The guard will open the door for him. The sheep will listen to him. He calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When all his own sheep are out of the house, he goes ahead of them. The sheep come behind him because they know his voice. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They will not go after a stranger. They will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus told this story to the Pharisees, but they did not understand what he was trying to tell them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Jesus told them again. He said, ‘I tell you the truth. I am the door of the sheep house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All those who came before me are bad people and steal things. They came to steal the sheep. But the sheep did not listen to them. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Some people work for pay. The one who does that is not the one who really cares. The sheep do not belong to him. When he sees a bad animal coming, he will leave the sheep and run away. He will let the animal take the sheep and make the sheep run away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He does that because he is only working for pay and does not care what happens to the sheep. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">‘I am the good shepherd, the one who really cares for the sheep. I know my sheep and my sheep know me. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">‘I have some other sheep which are not with these sheep. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice. Then all the sheep will be together and there will be one person who cares for all of them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">My Father loves me because I am willing to die. But when I die, I will live again. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one kills me. I die only because I choose to die. I have power to die and I have power to live again. This is what my Father has told me to do.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Jews did not all say the same thing because of what Jesus said. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of them said, ‘A bad spirit is in him. He is crazy. Why do you listen to him?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But others said, ‘A person who has a bad spirit in him does not say the things this man says. Can a bad spirit make blind people see?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At that time there was a feast in Jerusalem at the temple. It was the cold time of the year. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus was walking in that part of the temple called Solomon’s resting place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Jews came around Jesus and said, ‘How long will you keep us wondering about this matter? If you are really the Christ, then tell us plainly.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus said, ‘I have already told you and you did not believe it. My Father has given me the power to do big works. These works tell you who I am. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep. I told you this before. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">My sheep listen to me. I know them. They come to me. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">My Father and I are one.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the leaders of the Jews picked up stones again to kill him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So Jesus said to them, ‘I have done many good things that come from my Father. For which one of those are you going to kill me?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the Jewish leaders answered him, ‘We do not kill you for doing any good thing. But you do not respect God. You are only a man, and yet you say you are God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, ‘In your own books it is written that God said, “You are gods.” </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">Because of what he said, they tried to catch Jesus again. But he got away from them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He went away again to the other side of the Jordan River. He went to the place where John [the Baptizer] was when he first baptized people. Jesus stayed there for a while. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Many people came to him there. They said, ‘John himself did not do any big work. But everything that John said about this man is true.’ </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived at Bethany, the home of Mary and her sister Martha. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Mary was the same woman that put oil on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the sisters sent someone to tell Jesus. They said, ‘Lord, the one whom you love is sick.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus heard the message. He said, ‘The man is sick, but he will not die from it. But this will show people that God is great, and his Son also.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days more. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After that, he said to his disciples, ‘Let us go back again to Judea.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They said, ‘Master, it is not long since the Jews wanted to kill you with stones. Are you going back there again?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered them, ‘Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a person walks in the daylight, then he will not fall. He can see by the light that is in the world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if a person walks at night, he will fall because there is no light for him to see.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">After he said this, he said also, ‘Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I am going to wake him up.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His disciples said, ‘Lord, if he is sleeping then he will get well again.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jesus meant that Lazarus had died. The disciples thought that Lazarus was sleeping to have a rest. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus told them plainly. He said, ‘Lazarus is dead. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For your sake I am glad that I was not there. You will really believe in me. But come, let us go to him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples, ‘Let us all go and die with Jesus.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Bethany was only about two miles from Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary. They came to comfort them because their brother had died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary just stayed in the house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Martha said to Jesus, ‘Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But even yet, I know that God will give you anything that you ask for.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said, ‘Your brother will rise again.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Martha said, ‘I know that he will rise when the dead people are raised up on the last day.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said, ‘I am the one who will raise people up and give them life. The person who believes in me will live, even though he has died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Anyone who is living and who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She said, ‘Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ. I believe that you are the Son of God who was to come into the world.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When she had said this, she went back to call her sister. She said quietly, ‘Mary, the Master has come. He is calling you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and came to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus was not in the town yet. He was at the same place where Martha had met him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews who were in the house to comfort Mary saw her get up quickly and go out. They went after her. They said, ‘She is going to the grave to cry.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Mary reached the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she kneeled down before him and said, ‘Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus saw her crying. He saw the Jews who came with her crying also. Then his heart was troubled very much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">‘Where have you buried him?’ he said. ‘Come, Lord, and see,’ they said. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Jesus cried. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">‘Look,’ the Jews said. ‘He truly loved him very much!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then some of them said, ‘This man made the blind see. Could he not have saved Lazarus from dying?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus’ heart was troubled very much again. Then he came to the grave. It was a hole in the side of a large rock. A stone covered the hole. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, ‘Take the stone away.’ Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, ‘Lord, he will smell bad by this time. He has been dead four days already.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to her, ‘Did I not tell you that if you believed God you would see that he is great?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So they pushed the stone away from the grave. Jesus looked up and said, ‘Father, I thank you because you have heard me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I know that you always hear me. But I have said this so that the people who are standing here might believe that you have sent me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When he had said this, he shouted, ‘Lazarus, come out!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Out came the dead man! The cloth that they had buried him in was tied around his hands and feet. Another small cloth was tied around his face. Jesus said to the people, ‘Take off the cloths and free him!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">When they saw the things Jesus did, many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed on Him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So the chief priests and the Pharisees met together. They said, ‘What are we going to do? This man is doing many big works. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we do not stop him, everybody will believe on him. Then the Roman rulers will come and break down our holy town and our nation.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">One of them, Caiaphas, was high priest that year. He said to them, ‘You know nothing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">You do not understand. It is better for us if one person dies for the people. Then the whole nation will not be broken down.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He himself did not understand what he was saying. But he was the high priest that year. God spoke through him to say that Jesus should die for those people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Jesus would die, not only for those people, but he would gather together all of God’s people who are out in different places. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So from that day on they planned to kill Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">That is why Jesus did not go among the Jews in the open. But he went to another part of the country, to a town called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. Many people from all around the country went to Jerusalem. They had to make themselves clean according to the law before the Passover Feast. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They were looking around for Jesus. As they were standing in the temple they talked to one another. They said, ‘What do you think? Do you think that he will come to the feast?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Both the chief priest and the Pharisees had told the people, ‘If any man knows where he is, tell us. We want to catch him.’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Six days before the Passover Feast Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus lived. This was the Lazarus that Jesus had raised from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The people made supper for Jesus. Martha helped give food for the people, and Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Mary had a jar of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put some of it on Jesus’ feet. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The smell of oil went all through the house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, was there. He was one of the disciples, the one who was going to give Jesus over to the people who hated him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said, ‘This oil is worth a year’s wages! Why did we not sell it and give the money to poor people?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Judas did not say this because he cared for poor people. But he used to steal. He carried the disciples’ money bag and he used to take money out of the bag for himself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jesus said, ‘Leave her alone. She has kept this oil for the time when they will bury me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You will have poor people with you always. But you will not always have me with you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Many of the Jews knew that Jesus was at Bethany. So they came because Jesus was there. But they also came to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Many of the Jews left the priests and believed in Jesus, because of Lazarus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The next day Jesus went to Jerusalem. Many people who were at the feast heard that he was coming. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they took branches of palm trees and went to meet him. They shouted, ‘Praise God! God bless the King of Israel! He is coming in the name of the Lord!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it. He did as the holy writings say, </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">‘Do not fear, people of Jerusalem. Your King is coming. He will be riding on a young donkey.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">His disciples did not understand this at first. But when God had made Jesus great, then they remembered what the holy writings said about him. They remembered that people had done these things to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Many people were with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from death. They had talked about what he did. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That is why many people went out to meet Jesus. They had heard about the big work he did. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Pharisees said to each other, ‘See, you cannot stop this thing. People everywhere are going after him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Some of the people who came to worship God at the feast were Greek people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, ‘Sir, we want to see Jesus.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Philip came to Andrew and told him. Then they both went and told Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said, ‘The time has come when the Son of Man will be made great. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Before the Passover Feast had started, Jesus saw that the time had come for him to leave this world. The time had come for him to go back to his Father. He loved his own people who were in the world. And he loved them the same way right to the end. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Jesus was still tied up. Annas sent him over to Caiaphas the high priest. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Simon Peter stayed by the fire and stood warming himself. So the people said to him, ‘Are you not one of his disciples also?’ He said, ‘No, I am not!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">A servant was there. He was of the same family as the one whose ear Peter had cut off. He said, ‘Did I not see you in the garden with him?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Again Peter said, ‘No!’ And just then a cock called out. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the court house. It was early in the day. They themselves did not go into the court house. They did not want to become unclean. They wanted to eat the Passover Feast. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate went out to the Jewish leaders and said, ‘What complaint do you bring against this man?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They said to him, ‘If he were not a very bad man, then we would not have brought him to you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate said, ‘Take him and judge him by your own law.’ The leaders of the Jews said, ‘But we are not allowed to kill anyone.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So this is the way the words of Jesus came true. He had said how he was going to die. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Pilate went back into the court house again. He called for Jesus and asked him, ‘Are you the King of the Jews?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, ‘Do you ask me because you yourself think I am, or do you ask me because others said I am?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, ‘Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests have brought you here to me. Tell me, what have you done?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered him, ‘I am not a king in this world. If I were, my people would fight so that I would not be given to the Jews. But I am not a king in this world.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Pilate said, ‘So you really are a king then? ‘Jesus answered, ‘You say that I am a king. The reason that I was born was that I should tell what is true. That is why I came into the world. Everyone who likes what is true listens to what I say.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate said, ‘What is truth?’ When he had said this, he went out to the Jews again. He told them, ‘I find nothing wrong in this man. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But at the Passover Feast you always want me to let one prisoner go free for you. Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then they all shouted again, ‘Not this man, but Barabbas!’ Barabbas was a man who had stolen things.      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They said, ‘Greetings, King of the Jews!’ They beat him with their hands. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">When the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they shouted, ‘Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!’ Pilate said to them, ‘You take him and nail him to a cross. I find nothing wrong in him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (7-8) </STYLE>The leaders of the Jews answered him, ‘We have a law. That law says he should die, because he calls himself the Son of God.’ When Pilate heard what they said, he was very much afraid. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Pilate said, ‘Do you not answer me? Do you not know that I have power to nail you to a cross, or to let you go free?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus said, ‘You would have no power over me if God did not give you power. So then, the man who gave me up to you has done something worse than you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After that Pilate tried to let Jesus go free. But the Jews shouted, ‘If you let this man free, you are not Caesar’s friend! Anyone who makes himself a king is fighting against Caesar!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out. Then Pilate sat on the bench where the judge sits. The place was called the Street of Stone. The Jews called it Gabbatha. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Pilate gave them Jesus to be nailed to a cross. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They took Jesus and led him away. Jesus went out carrying his own cross. They went to a place which the Jews called Golgotha. That means ‘the place of the skull bone’. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes. They divided them into four parts and gave each soldier one part. Then they took his coat. It was not sewn together but the cloth was all made in one piece from the top to the bottom. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the soldiers said to one another, ‘We will not tear this. But let us gamble for it.’ What the holy writings say came true. They say, ‘They divided my clothes among them. They gambled for my coat.’ That is what the soldiers did. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near. He said to his mother, ‘Woman, see your son!’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">It was the day before the Sabbath day. The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day because it was a big day. So they begged Pilate to break the legs of those who had been nailed to crosses. Then they could be taken away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers came and broke the legs of the one nailed to the cross on one side of Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the one on the other side of him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">One of the soldiers stuck a spear into the side of Jesus’ body. Right away, blood and water came out. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">A man named Joseph, from the town of Arimathea, was a disciple of Jesus. But he did not say so because he was afraid of the leaders of the Jews. After all this had happened, he went to Pilate. He asked him to let him take Jesus’ body away. Pilate let him. So he came and took his body. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Nicodemus also came. He was the one who had come to Jesus at night. He brought with him a heavy bag of sweet-smelling spices called myrrh and aloes. It was mixed together. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">He also saw the small cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head. It was not with the other cloths, but it was folded together by itself in another place. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said to the others, ‘I am going fishing.’ The others said, ‘We are going with you also.’ They went out in a boat right away. That night they caught nothing. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to them, ‘Throw out your net on the right side of the boat, then you will catch some.’ They threw out their net and caught many fish, so that they were not able to bring in the net. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’ As soon as Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he put on his coat and his belt. He had taken off some clothes to work. Then he jumped into the water. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The other disciples came in a small boat. They were pulling the net. It was full of fish. They were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus came. He took bread and gave it to them. Then he took fish and gave it to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?’ He said, ‘Yes, Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my lambs.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He asked him the second time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ Peter said, ‘Yes, Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Take care of my sheep.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he asked Peter the third time, ‘Simon son of John, do you like me?’ Peter was sad because of the way Jesus asked him the third time. So he answered him, ‘Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you as a close friend’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I tell you the truth. When you were young, you put on your own belt. You went where you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will put out your hands. Others will put your belt on for you. They will take you where you do not want to go.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said this to show how Peter would die and make God’s name great. When he had finished saying this, he said to him, ‘Come and follow me!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter turned around. The disciple whom Jesus loved was coming with Jesus also. He was the one who was at Jesus’ right side at the supper table. He had said to Jesus, ‘Lord, who will give you over to people who hate you?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, ‘Lord, what about this man?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, ‘If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you? I want you to come and follow me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the report went around among the brothers that that disciple would not die. Jesus had not said to him, ‘You will not die.’ But he had said, ‘If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The same disciple said these things and wrote them. We know what he said is true. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">So when you sent for me, I did not say “No”. Now I ask, why did you send for me?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius answered, ‘Four days ago, it was just at this time, three o’clock. I was in my house talking with God. I had not eaten any food. A man stood in front of me wearing shining clothes. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They asked, ‘Why did you visit people who are not Jews? Why did you eat with them?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter explained to them all that had happened from the beginning. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">‘I was in the city of Joppa talking with God,’ he said. ‘Something like a dream came over me. I saw a vision. I saw a bundle like a big blanket tied by the corners. It was let down from the sky. It came down to me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When I looked at it, I wondered about it. I saw different kinds of tame animals, wild animals, snakes, and birds. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard a voice say to me, “Get up, Peter. Kill some and eat.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, “No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or clean.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the voice spoke from the sky a second time, saying, “What God has made clean, you must not call unholy.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This happened three times. Then everything was taken up into the sky again. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Right then three men came to the house where we were. They had come from Caesarea for me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit told me to go with them and not to fear. These six brothers went with me too. We went into the man’s house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He told us that he had seen God’s angel standing in his house. The angel said to him, “Send men to Joppa to call Simon whose other name is Peter. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He will tell you and all your family how to be saved.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them just as he had come on us at the beginning. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then I remembered that the Lord said, “John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God gave then the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. If God gave them this gift, how could I stop him? I am only a man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the people heard this, they were satisfied. They praised God saying, ‘God has allowed the people who are not Jews to turn to him and live.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Some of the people had gone to other countries because of the big trouble when Stephen was killed. They went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told God’s word to the Jews only. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene. They went to Antioch. They also spoke to those who were not Jews, and they told them about the Lord Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Lord was with them. Many believed and turned to the Lord. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people in the Jerusalem church heard this news. They sent Barnabas to go to Antioch. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he reached there, he saw what had been done by the power of God. He was very glad. He talked to them. He begged them all to keep on following the Lord with all their heart. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Barnabas was a good man. He believed in God and was filled with the Holy Spirit. Many people came to the Lord. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to get Saul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When he found him, he took him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with all who believed in Jesus Christ. They taught many people. Antioch was the first place where the disciples were called Christians. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">At that time, prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of them named Agabus stood up. He told them the Spirit had shown him that much trouble would come to all the world. There would not be much food for the people. (This trouble came when Claudius Caesar was ruler.) </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the disciples decided to help the Christian brothers who lived in Judea. They would each one send what he could. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They did so. They sent Barnabas and Saul to carry it to the church leaders [in Jerusalem].      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the king caught some of the church people and troubled them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He killed James the brother of John with a long knife or sword. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He saw that this pleased the leaders of the Jews, so he caught Peter also. This happened at the Jewish feast which they had each year to remember leaving Egypt. (It was called the Passover Feast.) </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">After Herod had caught Peter, he put him in prison. He told four groups of soldiers to guard him. There were four soldiers in each group. He planned to bring him out for trial before the people. But he would do it after the Passover Feast. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Peter was kept in prison. And the church people asked God to help him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers. He was tied to them with two chains. Guards were at the door of the prison. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">An angel from the Lord came to him and a light shone in the prison. He hit Peter’s side and woke him up. ‘Be quick,’ he said. ‘Get up!’ His chains fell off his hands. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">‘Put on your belt and your shoes,’ said the angel. Peter did so. ‘And now,’ said the angel, ‘put on your coat and follow me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Peter followed him out. He did not know that what the angel had done was true. He thought he was dreaming. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They passed the first and the second guard. Then they came to the iron gate out to the city. It opened for them by itself. So they went all the way down a street. Then the angel left him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Peter came to himself, he said, ‘Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel. He has saved me from Herod and from all that the Jewish leaders are hoping will happen to me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he thought about this, he went to Mary’s house. Mary was John Mark’s mother. Many people were meeting there, talking to God [about Peter]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Peter knocked at the outside door. A young servant woman named Rhoda went to answer. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she knew it was Peter’s voice, she was very glad. She did not open the door. But she ran in and told the people that Peter was at the door. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They said, ‘You are crazy.’ But she kept on saying that Peter was really there. Then they said, ‘It must be his angel.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Peter kept on knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were very much surprised. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He put out his hand for them to be quiet. Then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, ‘Tell James and the brothers about this.’ Then he went away to another place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In the morning the soldiers tried hard to find Peter. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Herod had looked for him and had not found him. So he questioned the guards and ordered them to be taken away and killed. And then Peter went from Judea to Caesarea to live for a while. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. But they got Blastus to speak to the king for them. Blastus was one of the men who worked in the king’s house. They came to Herod together. They wanted to make peace with him because their country got its food from his country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On a certain day Herod put on his king’s robes and sat on his chair and made a speech. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people shouted, ‘A god is talking to us. He is not a man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">At once an angel from God put a bad sickness on Herod because he did not give God the praise. Worms ate him and he died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The word of God spread further and further and more people believed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had finished their work. They brought John Mark with them.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who grew up with Herod the ruler, and Saul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They were worshipping the Lord and fasting [not eating food for a time]. The Holy Spirit said, ‘Give me Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have called them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The men fasted and talked to God. Then they laid their hands on Barnabas and Paul and sent them on their way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Barnabas and Saul left Antioch. The Holy Spirit sent them to the town of Seleucia. From there they went in a boat to the island of Cyprus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they reached the town of Salamis, they told God’s word in the meeting places of the Jews. John was with them to help. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They went through all the island to the town of Paphos. There they met a witch doctor. He was a Jew named Bar-Jesus. He was not a true prophet. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This witch-doctor was with Sergius Paulus, the ruler of the country. Sergius Paulus was a wise man. He wanted to hear God’s word, so he called for Barnabas and Saul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The witch-doctor was also called Elymas. He tried to stop them. He did not want the ruler to believe the truth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Saul, who is also called Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, looked at him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">‘You son of the devil!’ he said. ‘You do nothing but tell lies and make much trouble. You hate everything that is right. The Lord’s way is right. Will you not stop spoiling his way? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">See now, the Lord’s hand is upon you. You will be blind and will not be able to see the sun for a while.’ And right then something like a dark cloud came over Elymas’ eyes. He went around begging someone to take his hand and lead him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The ruler saw what had happened. And he was very much surprised at the teaching about the Lord. He believed it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Paul and his friends left Paphos in a boat. They went to the town of Perga in the district of Pamphylia. There John left them and went back to Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The others went on from Perga. They came to Antioch in the district of Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the meeting house and sat down. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">First, someone read from the books of the law and the prophets. Then the rulers of the meeting house called Paul and Barnabas and said, ‘Men and brothers, have you something to say that will help us? Please say it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Paul stood up and put out his hand. He said, ‘Men of Israel and you who worship and fear God, please listen to me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made the people into a large tribe when they were strangers in the land of Egypt. God brought them out of Egypt by his power. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For forty years in the wilderness God cared for them like a father. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">God took seven tribes out of the land of Canaan. Then he divided the land among our people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God gave judges to rule over them until Samuel the prophet came. About four hundred and fifty years had passed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the people asked for a king. God gave them Saul. He was the son of Kish, a man from Benjamin’s family. Saul was their king for forty years. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then God took him away. He made David king over them. This is what God said about him, “David, Jesse’s son, is the kind of man I love. He will do all that I want him to do.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">God has given Israel a Saviour from David’s family, as he promised to do. His name is Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Before he came, John [the baptiser] talked to all the people of Israel. He said they should stop doing wrong things and be baptised. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When John was finishing his work, he said, “Who do you think I am? I am not the one. But wait, someone else will come after me. I am not good enough to untie his shoe strings.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">‘Men and brothers, sons of Abraham, and all of you who worship God, the news of this way to be saved has been sent to us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know who this Jesus really was. They did not understand the words of the prophets of God long ago which were read every Sabbath day. But even so, they did what the prophets had said they would do. They judged him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They could not prove that he did anything wrong for which he should die. Yet they begged Pilate to kill him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They did all the things that the prophets had written about him. Then they took him down from the cross made from a tree. They laid him in a grave cut from the rock. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">People had come with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem. They saw him many days. Now they tell people what they saw. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And we are bringing you this good news. God made a promise to our fathers long ago. Now he has made his promise come true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">We, their children, have now received the promise. He sent Jesus just as it was written in the second psalm, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">‘God raised Jesus from death. His body did not go back to the grave to be spoiled. Here is what God said about it. “I will give to you the blessings which I promised David.” </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">‘As for David, he did the work God wanted him to do for the people in his time. Then, after that, he died. He was buried with his fathers. His body spoiled. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">As Paul and Barnabas left the meeting house the people said, ‘Tell us these things again next Sabbath day.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The meeting was finished. There were many Jews, also those who were not Jews but worshipped God. They followed Paul and Barnabas. Paul and Barnabus kept talking to the people and told them to keep on living in the way that will bring God’s blessing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The next Sabbath day almost all of the people in that city gathered to hear God’s word. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The leaders of the Jews saw that many people came. They were very jealous. They talked back to Paul and said he was not telling the truth. They also said wrong things about him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But Paul and Barnabas did not fear the Jewish leaders. They said, ‘We had to tell God’s word to you first but you will not listen to it. By that you are saying you Jews are not good enough to live for ever. So we will go to the people who are not Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">That is what the Lord told us to do. He said, “I have made you to be a light to the people who are not Jews. You will tell people everywhere in the world how to be saved.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Those who were not Jews heard this. They were glad and they thanked God for his message. All those who had been chosen to live for ever believed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The word of the Lord was told through all that part of the country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But the leaders of the Jews talked to the leading women who worshipped God and to the chief men of Antioch. They made plenty of trouble for Paul and Barnabas. They made them leave that part of the country. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and left them. They went on to Iconium. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And the followers were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In Iconium Paul and Barnabas did as they had done before in other places. They went into the Jews’ meeting place and spoke. Many of the Jews and the other people believed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the Jews who did not believe said wrong things about them. They spoiled the minds of those who were not Jews so that they hated the Christians. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time anyway. They did not fear to talk about the Lord. The Lord proved that the message about his blessing was true. He worked through Paul and Barnabas. They did signs and wonderful things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The people of the city were divided. Some of them agreed with the Jewish leaders. Some of them agreed with the apostles. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then some of those people who were not Jews joined together with the Jews and their leaders. They made a plan to give the apostles much trouble and to kill them with stones. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Paul and Barnabas found out about this. So they left quickly. They went to Lystra and Derbe in the district of Lycaonia and the country around. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There they told people the good news. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At Lystra a man was sitting. He was not able to walk because he had no strength in his feet. He had never walked since he was born. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This man heard Paul speak. Paul looked at the man. He saw that the man believed he would be healed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul said, ‘Stand up on your feet!’ The man jumped up and walked. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When the people saw what Paul had done, they shouted in their own language, ‘The gods have become like men! They have come down to visit us.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They named Barnabas, Jupiter. And they named Paul, Mercury, because he was the one who talked. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There was a temple of Jupiter in front of the city. The priest of the temple brought animals and flowers to the gates to make a sacrifice. All the people were with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes and ran in among the people shouting. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They said, ‘Why are you people doing this? We are only men like you. You should leave these gods which cannot help you. You should turn to the living God. He made the sky, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the time that is past, God allowed all people to do what they wanted to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But even then he had some ways to make himself known. He did things that were good. He gave us rain from the sky and good harvests. And he gives you all the food you need and makes you very happy. Surely these things speak for him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">By saying these things they stopped the people from making sacrifices to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Some of the Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and won the people to their side. They threw stones at Paul. Then they carried him out of the city because they thought he was dead. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But as the disciples gathered around him, he got up and they went back into the city. The next day Paul and Barnabas left and went to Derbe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They told the good news to the people in Derbe. Many people believed what they taught. Then they went back to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They talked to the disciples to help them. They told them to keep on believing. They said, ‘We must go through much trouble to get into God’s kingdom.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They chose leaders for them in every church. They talked with God and fasted. When they were finished, they gave the leaders over to the Lord’s care, because they believed in him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They went through the district of Pisidia to Pamphylia. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They told the good news to the people in Perga. Then they went to the town of Attalia. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">From there they went in a boat to Antioch. It was there that the people had given them over to God’s care. They had asked him to bless them in this work. Now they had finished the work. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When they reached the city, they called all the church people together. They told them all that God had done for them. They said, ‘Now God has opened the way to believe for those who are not Jews.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Paul and Barnabas stayed a long time with the disciples at Antioch.      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Some men came from Judea and taught the Christian brothers. They said, ‘You must be circumcised with the mark made on your body in the way Moses taught us. If you are not circumcised you cannot be saved.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Paul and Barnabas did not agree with them. There was much talking about it. Then they decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the other men should go to Jerusalem. They would ask the apostles and church leaders there about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the church people sent them on their way. They passed through the districts of Phoenicia and Samaria. They told them that some who were not Jews were believing in God. This news made all the Christian brothers very happy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church people, the apostles, and the church leaders. They told all that God had done as he worked with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group stood up and said, ‘They must be circumcised [like the Jews]. We must tell them to keep all the laws of Moses.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The apostles and the church leaders met together to talk the matter over. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After much talking about it, Peter stood up. He said, ‘Men and brothers, you know what happened in the first days. God chose me to tell the good news to those who are not Jews. They believed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God knows what is in a person’s heart. He proved that they believed. He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God made no difference between them and us. He made their hearts clean when they believed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So now why are you doing what God did not do? You give the disciples a hard thing to do. Our fathers could not do it. And we cannot do it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We believe that the Lord Jesus saves us because he is kind. And that is why he saves them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then all the people stopped talking. They listened to what Paul and Barnabas had to say. They told them about all the signs and wonderful things that God had helped them to do among the people who were not Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When they had finished talking, James said, ‘Men and brothers, listen to me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simeon has told us how God came the first time to the people who are not Jews. God chose some of them to belong to him and be his people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This is what the prophets of God said long ago. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They said, “After this, I will come back and build up again the house of David which has fallen down. I will take the broken pieces and build a house again. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then all the other people will find God, even those who are not Jews but who belong to me. So says the Lord, who is doing all these things.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">‘He told us these things long ago. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So now, this is what I think. We should not trouble those who are not Jews but who have turned to God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We should write them a letter and tell them what they must not do. They must not eat food that has been given to idols. They must not have sex with someone who is not their husband or wife. They must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. They must not taste blood. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Since the times of long ago there have been men who told about Moses in every city. They read his laws in the meeting places every Sabbath day.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the apostles, and the leaders, and all the church people chose men from among themselves. They sent them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas, whose other name was Barsabbas, and Silas. They were leaders among the Christian brothers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They sent a letter with them. It said, ‘The apostles, the church leaders, and the Christian brothers send greetings to the Christians who are not Jews in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">We have heard that some of our people visited you and talked to you. They taught things that troubled you and made you believe wrong things. They said, “You must be circumcised like the Jews and keep the law.” We did not tell them to teach you this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All of us gathered here have chosen some men. We are sending them with our dear brothers, Barnabas and Paul. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">You must not eat food that has been given to idols. You must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. You must not taste blood. You must not commit adultery. If you keep away from these things, you will do well. Goodbye.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said, ‘We are Romans. And they have beaten us outside where people can see. They have put us in prison without proving we have done wrong. Now, are they going to take us out of prison secretly? No, they themselves must come and take us out.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The soldiers told this to the judges. They were very much afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So they came to Paul and Silas. They said they were sorry for what they had done. They brought them out of prison and asked them to leave the city. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He proved these things from the writings. He said. ‘It was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from death. And this Jesus, whom I am talking about, is the Christ.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some of the people believed him and they followed Paul and Silas. Some of them were Greek people who worshipped God. And some were leading women. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some Jews did not believe, and they were jealous. So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd. They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city. At Jason’s house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them outside to the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they did not find them. So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city. They shouted, ‘These men have turned the world upside down. Now they have come here also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jason has taken them into his house. None of them obeys the laws of Caesar. They say there is another king named Jesus.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All the people and the rulers of the city became angry when they heard this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They made Jason and the other Christians pay much money. Then they let them go. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That night the Christian brothers sent Paul and Silas to the town of Berea. When they reached there, they went into the Jews’ meeting place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The people in Berea were better than the people of Thessalonica. They were glad to listen to Paul’s words. Every day they studied the holy writings to see if what Paul said was right. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Through this, many of them believed. Some of the leading women of the Greek people and some of the men also believed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The leaders of the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul told the word of God to the people at Berea. They came to Berea and talked to the people. They said things that made the people very angry against Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Christian brothers sent Paul to the seaside right away. But Silas and Timothy stayed on at Berea. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius. They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics. Some of them began to talk with Paul.

      <VERS vnumber="19">So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus. They said, ‘We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You are telling us things we never heard before. We want to understand them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">All the people of Athens and the strangers who lived there passed their time in one way. They liked to tell and to hear some new thing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Paul stood up in the court and said, ‘You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious and worship many gods. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As I walked about, I looked at the things you worship. I saw one place where you make sacrifices. You have written on it, “To the God we do not know.” You are worshipping that God, but you do not know him. I will tell you about him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He made the world and everything in it. He is the Lord of the sky and the earth. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Men cannot worship him by things they make with their hands because he does not need anything. He is the one who gives life and breath and everything else to all people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">God made one man. From that one man he has made all the nations of men to live on the whole earth. He has given to each nation a certain time and a certain place to live. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He did this so they would look for him. He wanted them to reach out and find him. But he is not far from each one of us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">In him we live, and move, and are alive. Some of your own writers have said, “We have come from him”. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">‘Therefore we have all come from God. So we should not think that God is something made of gold, or silver, or stone. He is not made by men’s hands. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In times past God did not look at what people did. They did not know any better then. But now he is calling all people to stop doing those things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">God has set a day when he will judge the whole world in the right way. He has chosen a man to do this. He has proved to all people who the man is. He has raised him from death.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When the people of Athens heard that someone had been raised from death, some of them laughed. Others said, ‘We want to hear you talk about this matter again some time.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So then Paul left them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But some men followed him and believed. Among those who believed was Dionysius. He was a judge in the Areopagus court. And a woman named Damaris believed. There were others also.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Paul left Athens and went to the city of Corinth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There he met a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus. A short time before this he and his wife Priscilla had come from the country of Italy. They left Italy because Claudius the ruler had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. This was the big city in Italy. Paul went to the house of Aquila and Priscilla. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul’s work had been the making of tents, and that is what they did. So he stayed with them. They worked together. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Every Sabbath day he talked with the people in the meeting place for the Jews. He tried to talk so that the Jews and the Greeks would believe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul felt in his heart that he must prove to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the people talked back to Paul. And they said wrong things about him. Paul shook his clothes and said to them, ‘If you are lost, it is your own fault, not mine! From now on I will go to those who are not Jews.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he left. He went to the house of a man named Justus who worshipped God. His house was next to the meeting place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Crispus was the head ruler of the meeting house. He and his whole family believed in the Lord. Many of the people in Corinth heard and believed. And they were baptised. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord said to Paul in a vision in the night, ‘Do not fear. Keep on speaking. Do not stop. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am with you. Nobody will hurt you. I have many people in this city.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Paul stayed there for one year and six months. He taught the people God’s word. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Gallio was the ruler of the province of Achaia, the Jews got together to stop Paul. They took him to court. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They said, ‘This man is talking to the people. He is trying to make them worship God in a way that is against our law.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Paul wanted to speak. Then Gallio said to the Jews, ‘You Jews, if it were a matter of wrong or of doing something very bad, I would listen to you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But this is a matter about words and names and about your own law. So you must go and take care of it yourselves! I will not judge such things.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them out of the court. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They caught a man. His name was Sosthenes. He was the head ruler of the meeting house. They beat him in front of the judge, but Gallio did nothing about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Paul stayed there for many days. Then he said goodbye to the Christian brothers and went in a boat to the country of Syria. Priscilla and Aquila went with him. In the town of Cenchrea he cut his hair off. This was because he had made a promise to God. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">When he reached Caesarea, he went to greet the church people. Then he went on to Antioch. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He stayed there for a while. Then he left and went through all the countries of Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the disciples to believe more strongly. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">A Jew came to Ephesus. His name was Apollos. He was born in Alexandria. He spoke with power and was able to explain the holy writings well. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Apollos decided to go into Achaia. The Christian brothers wrote to the disciples there and asked them to receive him. When he reached Achaia, he helped very much those who believed. They believed because God was kind to them. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul asked them, ‘How were you baptised?’ They said, ‘We were baptised in John’s way.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Paul said, ‘John baptised people when they stopped their wrong ways. He told people that they should believe on the one who would follow him. That one is Jesus.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Paul put his hands on them. Then the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues of other lang-uages and spoke words from God. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul went down stairs. He lay on him and put his arms around him. ‘Do not fear,’ he said. ‘He is alive.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Paul went upstairs again. He broke bread and ate some food. He talked for a long time, until daybreak. After that, he left. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The people took the young man. They were very glad because he was alive. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We went by boat to the town of Assos. We were going to meet Paul there and take him on the boat. He told us to do that because he wanted to walk. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We met him at Assos, took him on the boat, and went to Mitylene. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then we went by boat the next day and came to Chios. The next day we passed the town of Samos. We reached Miletus on the third day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Paul decided not to stop at Ephesus. He did not want to spend time in Asia Minor. He kept going as fast as he could, because he hoped to be at the feast in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He sent a message from Miletus to Ephesus to call the leaders of the church to come to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they came, he said, ‘You know how I have lived all the time that I have been with you. I lived that way from the first day I came into Asia. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You know how I have served the Lord without being proud. And I have even cried for you. I served the Lord when I had troubles and when the leaders of the Jews tried to catch me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have not feared to tell you everything that would help you. I have taught you in meetings and in your homes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I have told both the Jews and the Greeks to stop doing wrong things. I have told them to believe in our Lord Jesus Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">‘And now I feel in my spirit that I must go to Jerusalem. I do not know what will happen to me there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But in every city the Holy Spirit tells me I will be put in prison. I will have much trouble. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But none of these things trouble me. I do not try to save my life. All I want is to finish what I must do with joy. The work which the Lord Jesus gave me is to tell the good news that God is kind. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I know that you all will never see me again. I have told you about God’s kingdom. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So I tell you today that if any one is lost, it is not my fault. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I have not feared to tell you all that God wants you to know. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">‘The Holy Spirit has made you leaders over his people. Watch yourselves. Like one who takes care of his sheep, so you must take care of the church people. They are the Lord’s people. He gave his blood for them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know this, that there are people as bad as wild animals. After I leave you, they will come to you. They will trouble God’s people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Also, some men will come from among you. They will teach things that are not true. They want people to follow them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So then, watch and remember this. For three years, through the night and in the day, I told every one of you to be careful. I even cried as I told you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">‘And now, my brothers, I give you to God. I leave with you his word which brings blessing. That word is able to make you strong. It will give you your share in the good things of God promised by him. He gives these good things to people who are pure and holy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I did not want anyone to give me money or clothes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to pay for the things that I and my friends needed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I have always shown you that you must work hard, as I have. You must help those who cannot work. By so doing you are remembering the words of the Lord Jesus. He said, “It makes you more happy to give something than to get something.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When Paul had said this, he kneeled down and talked to God with them all. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They all cried much. They put their arms around his neck and kissed him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They were sad most of all because he had said they would not see him again. And they went with him to the boat.      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When we had said goodbye to them, we left them. We went straight across the water to the island of Cos. The next day we came to the island of Rhodes. Then we went to the city of Patara. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There we found a boat going to the country of Phoenicia, so we went there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When we saw the island of Cyprus, we went on the right side of it to Syria. We landed at Tyre because they unloaded the boat there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We found some Christians and stayed for seven days. The Holy Spirit spoke through them to Paul, ‘Do not go on to Jerusalem.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the seven days had passed, we left and went on our way. All of the men, women, and children went with us out of the city. There by the sea we kneeled down and talked to God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We said goodbye to each other. Then we got on the boat and they went back to their homes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">From Tyre we went to Ptolemais. There we greeted the Christian brothers and stayed with them one day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went into the house of Philip. He was a man who went out telling the good news. He was one of the seven helpers in the church. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He had four daughters who spoke words from God. They were not married. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">While we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came from Judea. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When he came to us, he took Paul’s belt. He tied his own hands and feet with it. Then he said, ‘The Holy Spirit has told me that in the same way the leaders of the Jews in Jerusalem will tie the man who owns this belt. They will give him over to the people who are not Jews.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When we heard this, both we and the people there talked to Paul and begged him not to go to Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Paul answered, ‘Why are you crying and making me sad like this? I am ready to be tied and also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when we saw that he would not change his mind, we stopped begging him. We said, ‘May the Lord do what he wants to be done.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After that, we took our things and went to Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some of the Christians from Caesarea went with us. One of them was Mnason, a man born in Cyprus. He was one of the first Christian believers. We stayed in his house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When we reached Jerusalem, the Christian brothers were glad to see us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The next day Paul went with us to see James. All the church leaders were there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">First, Paul greeted them. Then he told them one by one the things God had done as he worked among the people who were not Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they heard it, they praised the Lord. They said to Paul, ‘Brother, there are many thousands of Jews who believe. They all say we must obey the law of Moses. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They have heard that you teach all the Jews who live in other lands. They heard that you tell them not to obey Moses’ law: that they need not circumcise their children like the Jews do; and they can leave the Jewish ways of living. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What should we do about it? Many people will gather together because they will surely hear that you have come. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now then, do the thing we tell you. We have four men who have made a promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Take them with you. Make yourself clean with them, the way the law says to do. Pay the cost for having their hair cut. Then all the people will know that all the things they heard about you are not true. They will know that you live the way the law says you should live. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">We sent a letter to those who are not Jews and have believed. Here is what we told them they must not do. They must not touch things that have been given to idols. They must not taste blood. They must not eat the meat of animals that were killed by choking. And they must not take part in any kind of wrong sexual behaviour between men and women.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul took the men with him. The next day he made himself clean with them the way the law says to do. Then he went into the temple. He told the priests which day they would finish making themselves clean. On that day a sacrifice would be made for each one of them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The seven days were almost over. The Jewish leaders from Asia Minor saw Paul in the temple. They got all the people there excited. They caught hold of him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They shouted, ‘All you men of Israel, come and help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere not to respect our people. He says we need not obey the law or respect this temple. And what is more, he has brought Greek people into the temple. He has made this holy place unclean.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They said this because they had seen a man from Ephesus named Trophimus. He was in the city with Paul. And they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So all the people in the city were excited. They came running. They caught Paul and took him out of the temple by force. Then the doors were shut behind them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They were trying to kill him. The officer in charge of the soldiers heard that all the people of Jerusalem were making trouble. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Right away he took some soldiers and officers with him and ran down to the people. When the people saw them they stopped beating Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the officer came up and took Paul. He had him tied with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Some of the crowd shouted one thing and some of them shouted something else. The captain could not find out what was true. The people were shouting too much. So he told his soldiers to take Paul into their army house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When Paul came to the steps, the soldiers carried him because the people were fighting to get him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">They were all following, shouting, ‘Kill him!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (37-38) </STYLE>Just as the soldiers were going to take Paul into their army house, he said to the officer, ‘May I tell you something?’ ‘So, you speak the Greek language!’ said the officer. ‘I thought you were the man from the country of Egypt who made trouble a while ago. I thought you were the one who led four thousand bad men into the desert.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Paul said, ‘I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I belong to a great city. Please let me talk to these people.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So the officer let him talk. Paul stood on the steps and put up his hand. Then all the people were very quiet. He talked to them in the Jews’ language.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul said, ‘Men, brothers, and fathers, listen while I tell you my side of this matter.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (2-3) </STYLE>When the people heard him speak in the Jews’ language, they were even more quiet. Then Paul said, ‘I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. But I was raised here in this city. Gamaliel was my teacher. He taught me very well in the law of our fathers. I was trying hard to obey God, just as you all are today. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I troubled very much the people who believed this Way. I even killed them. I had men and women tied and put into prison. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The high priest and all the leaders know that this is true about me. They wrote letters for me to carry to the leaders of the Jews in the city of Damascus. I went to have the Christians there tied and brought to Jerusalem to be punished.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">‘I was on my way and was near Damascus. It was about midday. All at once a very bright light from the sky shone all around me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I fell to the ground and heard someone say to me, “Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I said, “Who are you, Lord?” He answered, “I am Jesus of Nazareth. You are troubling me.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The men who were with me saw the light. They were afraid. But they did not hear the one who spoke to me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then I said, “Lord, what shall I do?” And the Lord said to me, “Get up and go to Damascus. There someone will tell you all you must do.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I could not see because the light was so bright. My friends led me by the hand to Damascus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">‘A man named Ananias was there. He obeyed the law of Moses, and all the Jews who lived there spoke well of him. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">‘After I went back to Jerusalem, I was talking to God in the temple one day. Something like a dream came over me. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">The people listened to Paul until he said that. Then they shouted, ‘Kill him and get him off the earth. A man like that should not live!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The people shouted. They waved their clothes about and threw dust in the air. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The man in charge of the soldiers ordered Paul to be brought into the army house. He said that he should be beaten hard to make him tell why the people shouted so much at him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they had tied him with ropes, Paul said to the captain who was standing by, ‘Is it right for you to beat a man who belongs to Rome without judging his case?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the captain heard this, he told the commanding officer. He said, ‘What are you going to do? This man is a Roman!’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">The officer wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders were angry with Paul. So the next day he had Paul untied. He called the chief priests and the leaders to hold a court meeting. Then he took Paul down and brought him in before them.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul looked at the members of the court and said, ‘My brothers, I have done what I thought God wanted me to do, right up to this day.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ananias, the high priest, said to those who were standing near Paul, ‘Hit his mouth!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul said, ‘God will hit you down, you dirty wall painted white! You sit there to judge me by the law and you break the law by telling them to hit me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The people who stood near Paul said, ‘Do you say a wrong thing like that to God’s high priest?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Paul said, ‘I did not know that he is a high priest. The holy writings say, “You shall not say anything wrong about a ruler of your people.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Paul knew that some of the men were from the Sadducee group and some of them were from the Pharisee group. So he called out in the court, ‘My brothers, I am a Pharisee. My fathers were Pharisees. I am being judged because I believe that the dead will be raised to life again.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he had said that, the Pharisees and the Sadducees began to talk back and forth. The men in the court were divided. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Sadducees say the dead will not be raised again. They say there is no angel or spirit. But the Pharisees believe in all these three things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was much shouting. Some of the clever men who were Pharisees got up. They said, ‘We do not think this man has done wrong. Perhaps some angel or spirit really did speak to him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The people started fighting. The commanding officer was afraid they would tear Paul into pieces. So he told the soldiers to take Paul and bring him into the army house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The next night the Lord stood beside Paul. He said, ‘Be glad, Paul. You have told people about me in Jerusalem. You must also talk about me in Rome.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In the morning, some of the Jewish leaders planned together. They made a promise that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were more than forty Jews who made this secret plan together. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They came to the chief priests and leaders and said, ‘We have made a promise for ourselves. We will not eat anything until we have killed Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So now, you and the members of the court send word to the commanding officer. Tell him to bring Paul down to you. Make him think you want to find out more about Paul. We will be ready to kill him before he gets there.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The son of Paul’s sister heard about their secret plan. So he went into the army house and told Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Paul called one of the officers and said to him, ‘Take this young man to the commanding officer. He has something to tell him!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So the officer took him to the commanding officer. He said, ‘Paul, the prisoner, called me. He asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The officer took the young man by the arm. He went to one side so they could be alone. He asked, ‘What do you want to tell me?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man said, ‘The leaders of the Jews have made a plan. They will ask you to bring Paul down to court tomorrow. They will say that they wish to find out more about him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But you must not do this. More than forty Jews are waiting for him. They have made a promise to themselves. They will not eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now and waiting for your agreement.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the commanding officer sent the young man away. He said, ‘You must not tell anyone that you have told me about these things.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The commanding officer called two officers to him. He said, ‘Get two hundred soldiers ready by nine o’clock tonight to go to Caesarea. Send seventy men with them who will ride on horses and two hundred men who will carry spears. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Also have horses ready for Paul to ride. Take him safely to Felix, the ruler.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The officer wrote a letter to Felix like this: </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">‘Claudius Lysias sends greetings to you, great ruler Felix. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was caught by the Jews. They were ready to kill him. But I came with my soldiers and took him away, because I found out that he is a Roman. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I wanted to find out what complaint they had against him, so I brought him into their court. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I found out that their complaints were to do with their law. But he had not done anything wrong enough to die or to be put into prison. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When I heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him, I sent him to you at once. I told those who are making complaints against him that they must bring the matter to you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the soldiers took Paul as they had been told to do. They went with him that night as far as the town of Antipatris. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The next day the soldiers went back to the barracks. Only the men who were riding horses went with Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When they reached Caesarea, they gave the letter to the ruler and brought Paul to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (34-35) </STYLE>He read the letter. Then he asked Paul what country he came from. He heard that Paul was from Cilicia.

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Five days later, Ananias the high priest came from Jerusalem. He brought with him some of the leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They told the ruler their complaint against Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Paul was called in. Tertullus began to bring the complaints. ‘Great ruler Felix,’ he said, ‘we have peace because of what you have done. These people have a better life because of you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We are always very glad for this everywhere we go. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I do not want to take much of your time. But please be kind and listen to a few words from us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We have found this man to be a real trouble-maker. He talks to the Jews all over the world and causes them to disobey the laws. He is the leading trouble-maker of the Nazarene group. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He even tried to make the temple unclean. But we caught him and were going to judge him by our law. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Lysias the commanding officer came. He took Paul away from us by force. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He told those who have complaints against him to come to you. Ask him yourself and you will find out from him about all these complaints we have brought against him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Jews agreed with what Tertullus the lawyer said. They said, ‘Yes, yes, he is telling the truth.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The ruler made a sign for Paul to speak. So Paul said, ‘I know that for many years you have judged matters for this people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I am happy to speak for myself. Not more than twelve days ago I went to Jerusalem to worship. If you ask the people, you will find this out. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They did not find me quarrelling with anyone in the temple. I was not making trouble among the people in the meeting houses or in the city. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They cannot prove the things they have said against me here. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I myself tell you this. I worship the God of my fathers in the Christian way. They say this is not the right way. I believe everything that the law teaches. I believe everything that the prophets have written. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I believe that God will raise from death both the good people and the bad people. These people here believe the same thing. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">‘I was away for a few years and I had come to Jerusalem to bring gifts to my people, and to give offerings. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Felix sent them away because he knew many things about the Christian way. He said, ‘When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will know everything about this matter.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to the officer, ‘Keep Paul in prison but let him have some freedom. Let his friends come to visit him and to do things for him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some days after that, Felix came with his wife Drusilla. She was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to what Paul said about believing in Christ Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Paul talked about what is right, about living the right way, and about the time when all people will be judged. Felix was very much afraid when he heard these things. He said to Paul, ‘You may go now. When I have time, I will call you again.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him. And so he often sent for Paul and talked with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After two years, a man named Porcius Festus came to rule in Felix’s place. Felix had wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he left Paul in prison.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Three days after Festus came to the country, he went to Jerusalem from Caesarea. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews told him what they had against Paul. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">‘Please do something for us,’ they begged. ‘Send for Paul to come to Jerusalem.’ They had made a secret plan to kill him on the road. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Festus said, ‘Paul is being kept in prison in Caesarea. I myself am going there soon. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let the men among you who are able come with me. If Paul has done anything wrong, then they can talk against him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Festus stayed only eight or ten days more among them. Then he went to Caesarea. The next day he sat on his chair in the court and had Paul brought in. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Paul came in, the Jewish leaders who had come from Jerusalem stood around Paul. They talked much against him. But they could not prove that the things they said were true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Paul spoke for himself. He said, ‘I have done no wrong to the law, or to the temple, or against Caesar the ruler of the Romans.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Festus wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he said to Paul, ‘Will you go to Jerusalem and let me judge you there about these things?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul said, ‘I am standing in Caesar’s court. That is where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews. You yourself know that well. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If I have done wrong things, or any wrong thing for which I should die, then I do not ask to live. But if the things these people say are not true, then no one has power to give me up to the leaders of the Jews. I ask to go to Caesar.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Festus talked the matter over with the court. Then he said to Paul, ‘You have asked to go to Caesar. All right, you will go to Caesar!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Some time after that, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They stayed for many days. Festus brought Paul’s matter to the king. He said, ‘Felix left a man in prison here. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priest and leaders of the Jews came to me. They talked against him, and they asked me to punish him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I told them that the Romans do not do it that way. They do not punish a man until he has met those who talk against him. Then he has a chance to speak for himself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they came here with me. I did not wait. The very next day I sat on my chair in the court and had the man brought in. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they stood up, they did not say the wrong things against him that I thought they would. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But instead, they had a quarrel with him about the things they believe in. The quarrel is about a man named Jesus who died. Paul said he is alive. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I did not know how to judge such things. So I asked if he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Paul asked to wait and let Caesar judge his case. So I had him put in prison to be kept there until I can send him to Caesar.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Agrippa said to Festus, ‘I should like to hear the man myself.’ Festus said, ‘Tomorrow you shall hear him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came, making a big show of themselves. They went into the room to hear Paul talk. Officers and the leading men of the city also went in. When Festus called for Paul, he was brought in. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Festus said, ‘King Agrippa and all you men here with us, you see this man. All the Jewish leaders, both in Jerusalem and here, came together and talked about him. They shouted, “He must die!” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I found out that he had not done anything wrong for which he should die. He himself asked to go to Caesar, so I decided to send him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But I have no real complaint about him to write to my ruler. So I have brought this man before you all, and most of all before you, king Agrippa. When you have heard him, I hope I will have something to write about him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I think that it does not make sense to send a prisoner and not say what wrong he has done.’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Agrippa said to Paul, ‘You may speak for yourself.’ So Paul put out his hand and began to speak. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">‘King Agrippa, I am happy to speak for myself before you today. I will talk about all the things the leaders of the Jews have said against me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You know all the ways of the Jews. You know what they believe. So please take time to listen to me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">‘All the Jews know the way I lived from the time I was young. From the beginning I lived with my own people at Jerusalem. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They have known me for a long time. They know, if they would tell it, that I lived like the Pharisee group. They obey the law better than any others who worship God the way we do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I believe that God will keep the promise that he made to our fathers long ago. That is why I am standing here being judged today. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the people of our twelve tribes serve God faithfully day and night. They do this because they believe they will receive what he has promised. Because I believe this, king Agrippa, the Jewish leaders are talking against me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why is it so hard for any of you to believe that God should raise the dead? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">‘I used to think that I must do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I did this in Jerusalem. The chief priests gave me power. I put many of God’s people in prison. And when they were killed, I agreed to it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Often I punished them in all the meeting places. I tried to make them say wrong things about Christ. I was very, very angry. I even went to other cities to trouble them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">‘And so I was on my way to the city of Damascus. The chief priests had given me power and a letter. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I was on the road at midday, king Agrippa, and I saw a bright light. It came from the sky and was brighter than the light of the sun. It shone all around me and the men who were travelling with me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We all fell to the ground. I heard someone say to me in the Jews’ language, “Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me? You hurt yourself when you kick against the sticks which guide you.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">‘I said, “Who are you, Lord?” And the Lord said, “I am Jesus, the one you are troubling. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But get up. Stand on your feet. Here is why I have shown myself to you. I have chosen you to work for me. I have chosen you to tell people what you saw when you saw me today. You are to tell them also about the other times when I will show myself to you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I will keep you safe from your own people, the Jews. And I will keep you safe from those who are not Jews. I am sending you to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I send you to them to open their eyes. Then they will turn from darkness to light. You are to take them out of Satan’s power and turn them to God, to be forgiven of their wrong ways. Then they will be among those who are made clean and pure by believing in me.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">‘So, king Agrippa, I obeyed what the one from heaven told me to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I told the good news to the people of Damascus and Jerusalem. Then I told it all over Judea. I went to those who are not Jews. I told everyone that they must stop doing wrong things and turn to God. I told them they must show by the way they live that they have stopped doing wrong things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">That is why the leaders of the Jews caught me in the temple and tried to kill me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God has always helped me up to today. I have stood and talked to both small people and great people. I have said nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They said Christ must suffer. They said he would be the first person to rise from death. He would be the first person to bring news of light to the Jews and those who are not Jews.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">While Paul was saying these things Festus shouted, ‘Paul, you are crazy! All your book learning is making you crazy.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Paul said, ‘No, great ruler Festus, I am not crazy. But what I say is true. It makes good sense. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king knows about these things. I am not afraid to talk to him about them. I am sure that not one of these things happened without his knowing about it. This did not happen in secret. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Agrippa said to Paul, ‘You are trying to make me a Christian right away.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">‘Right away or later,’ said Paul. ‘I wish that all who hear me today might be what I am. That is, what I am without these chains.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then king Agrippa stood up. Festus and Bernice and those who were sitting there with them stood up also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They left the room and talked the matter over. They said, ‘This man is not doing anything wrong for which he ought to be in prison or die.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Agrippa said to Festus, ‘We could let this man go free if he had not asked to go to Caesar.’      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It was planned that we would go by boat to Italy. An officer named Julius was put in charge of Paul and some other prisoners. Julius was an army captain in the Augustan group. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We got on a boat which was from the city of Adramyttium. This boat was going along the coast of Asia Minor. And so we went out to sea. A man named Aristarchus from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia came with us also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next day we stopped at the city of Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul. He allowed him to go to see his friends so they could care for him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then we started out to sea again. We went near the island of Cyprus, because the wind was blowing against us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We crossed the sea by the countries of Cilicia and Pamphylia. Then we reached the city of Myra in Lycia. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There the officer found a boat from the city of Alexandria going to the country of Italy. So he put us on that boat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We went slowly for many days. And after much trouble, we reached the city of Cnidus. The wind was blowing hard against us. We could not go on. So we went around the south side of the island of Crete, past Cape Salmone. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We had trouble going along near the coast, but at last we came to a place called Fair Havens. This was near the town of Lasea. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It was now so late in the year that it was a bad time to go by boat. So Paul spoke to them about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, ‘Sirs, I see that if we go on by boat, we will have much trouble. Something bad will happen to the things on the boat and to the boat itself, and also to us.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The officer did not listen to what Paul said. But he listened to the captain and the owner of the boat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This place was not a good place for the boat to stay through the winter months of the year. So most of the men wanted to go on. They thought they might be able to reach Phoenicia and stay there for the winter. Phoenicia is a good place on the island of Crete. Boats can stay there. The winds do not blow against them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the south wind began to blow a little, they thought they had what they wanted. So they started off. They went along very close to the land of Crete. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But soon a very strong north-east wind blew from Crete. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The wind blew against the boat and it could not go into the wind. So they let the boat go where the wind took it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">We came close to a small island called Clauda. There we had a hard time to pull up the small boat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">However, at last they got it up. Then they put ropes around the boat to make it strong. They were also afraid they would get stuck in a bad place in the sand. So they took down the big sail cloth that was up to catch the wind. Then they let the boat go where the wind took it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The next day the storm was very bad. They threw out the things that were in the boat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the third day they threw off the things they used on the boat, with their own hands. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For many days we could not see the sun or the stars. The bad storm kept on. We did not think that we would be saved. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The men of the boat had not eaten anything for a long time. Then Paul stood up and said, ‘Sirs, you should have listened to me and not left Crete. But you did leave. So you have had much trouble and have lost all these things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now I tell you to be glad. Not one of you will die. Only the boat will break and be lost. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I belong to God and worship him. Last night his angel stood before me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said, “Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caesar. And see, God has given you the lives of all these men who are travelling with you.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So be glad, sirs. I believe God. It will be just the way he told me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">However, we will have to go on an island.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">On the fourteenth night we were being blown across the Adrian Sea. About midnight the boatmen thought that we must be near some land. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So they tested how deep the water was there. They found that the line went down twenty arm lengths. A little later they tested and found that it was only fifteen arm lengths deep. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then they were afraid that we would hit the rocks. There were four heavy iron hooks called anchors. They let them down into the water at the back end of the boat. Then they wished that morning would come. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The boatmen wanted to get off and leave the boat. They even put down the small boat into the water. They said they were going to put more anchors out from the front of the big boat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But Paul said to the officer and soldiers, ‘If these men do not stay on the boat, you cannot be saved.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the small boat and let the water carry it away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When it was almost morning, Paul begged them all to eat. He said, ‘Today is the fourteenth day that you have been watching and have not eaten anything. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So now, I beg you, eat something. You need it to make you strong so you can save yourselves. Not one of you will lose even one hair from your head.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When he had said this, he stood in front of them all. He took some bread and thanked God for it. Then he broke it and began to eat it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then they all were glad and ate some food themselves. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In all, we were 276 people on the boat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They ate all they wanted. Then they threw the grain into the water, so that the boat would not be so heavy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">In the morning they saw land. But they did not know what country it was. They saw a sandy place. So they talked it over and thought they would try to get the boat on it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They cut off the anchors and left them in the water. At the same time, they untied the wood that guided the boat. They put up the big sail to catch the wind and tried to get the boat onto that sandy place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But they came to a place where there was sand under the water. The boat stuck in it. The front end stuck so badly that they could not make it go. The back end began to break up because the water beat it so hard. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim to land and run away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the officer wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers. He told the people, ‘Those of you who can swim, jump into the water first and get to the land. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then the rest of you jump in and go on planks and other pieces of the boat.’ So in this way they all got to the land safely.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When we were safe on land, we found that the island we were on was called Malta. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The people there were very kind to us. They made a fire for us and took care of us. It was cold and raining. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul gathered some sticks of wood. He put them on the fire. A bad snake came out of the heat and hung onto his hand. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The people of Malta saw the snake hanging on his hand. ‘Oh,’ they said to each other. ‘This man has no doubt killed someone. He did not die in the water, but it is not right for him to live.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Paul shook the snake off into the fire. It did not hurt him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The people thought surely he would swell up or would drop down dead at once. They waited a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him. Then they said, ‘We were wrong. He must be a god.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The ruler of the island was a man named Publius. He owned some of the land there. He took us to his house for three days and was very kind to us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The father of Publius was sick with fever, and blood was coming from his body. Paul went to see him. He talked to God and put his hands on the man. He healed him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this, other sick people on the island came to Paul. And they too were healed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They gave us many things. When we went away, they put on the boat for us the things that we would need. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A boat from the town of Alexandria was at the island all through the winter time. It was marked with a sign of the Twin Brothers. After we had been on the island for three months, we went on that boat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then we went to the city of Syracuse and stayed for three days. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After that we turned the boat along the coast. We reached the town of Rhegium. When we had been there for a day, a south wind began to blow. On the second day we came to the city of Puteoli. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (14-15) </STYLE>There we found some Christian brothers. They asked us to stay with them for seven days. Then we went to Rome. Some of the Christians at Rome had heard about us. They came to places called the Market Place of Appius and the Three Hotels. There they met us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God. It made him strong and glad to see these brothers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to stay in a house by himself with the soldier who guarded him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">After three days, Paul called for the leaders of the Jews at Rome. When they had come, he said to them, ‘My brothers, I have done nothing against our people. I have obeyed the laws of our fathers. And yet I was made a prisoner at Jerusalem and was given over to the Romans. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the Romans judged my case in court, they wanted to let me go free. They said there was no reason to kill me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the Jewish leaders did not agree to let me go free, so I had to ask to be brought before Caesar. I did not have anything to say against my people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now, here is why I have asked to see you and to talk to you. I am a prisoner tied with chains because I believe the same promise the Jews believe.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said to him, ‘The people of Judea have not written us any letter about you. When our brother Jews have come here, not one of them has told or said anything wrong about you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we want to hear from you what you think. We know that people everywhere are talking against this Christian group.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So they chose a certain day. On that day many of them came to the house where Paul was staying. He told them about God’s kingdom. He tried to make them understand about Jesus by the things that were written in the law of Moses and in the books of the prophets. He talked from morning until evening. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some of the people were ready to believe what he said, but others did not believe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They did not agree among themselves. So they started to go away. But before they left, Paul said one more thing. ‘What the Holy Spirit said was right. He spoke to your fathers long ago through Isaiah, the prophet of God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He said, “Go to these people and say, ‘You will hear but never understand. You will look but never see. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The hearts of these people have become hard. They do not hear with their ears. They have shut their eyes. They do not want to see with their eyes. They do not want to hear with their ears. They do not want to understand with their hearts. If they did, they would turn back to me and I would forgive them.’”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Paul said, ‘Therefore know this. The message that God will save them has been sent to those who were not Jews. They will listen to it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When Paul had said these words, the Jewish leaders went away. They were talking amongst themselves about these things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Paul stayed in Rome for two whole years in a house he paid money to live in. He was glad to see all who came to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He told them about God’s kingdom and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ. He did this freely without fear. No one stopped him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I am Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. He called me to be an apostle and to tell God’s good news. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Through his prophets long ago God promised this good news to people, in the holy writings. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The good news was about his Son. He is Jesus Christ our Lord. He was a man born in David’s family. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He came alive from death. That showed he was God’s Son. He had God’s power. God’s Holy Spirit did all this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This same Jesus Christ was kind to me. And he made me an apostle. I am sent in his name so that people in all nations will obey him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You are some of them. You were called to belong to Jesus Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I send greetings to all the Christians who live in the city of Rome. God loves you and has called you to be his people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you. In their kindness may they give you peace. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">People in all the world have heard that you believe. I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God knows that I always talk to him about you. I worship him in my heart while I tell the good news about his Son. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I ask God that in some way now I may be able to visit you, if he wishes me to do it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I want very much to see you. I want to give you some gift from the Holy Spirit to make you stronger. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I mean to say that we will both be helped. I will be helped because you believe, and you will be helped because I believe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">My brothers, I want you to know that I have often planned to come to you. But something has stopped me until now. I planned to come so that I might see good things happen among you. I have done this in the other nations which are not Jewish. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is something I must do for the Greek people and for all other people. I must do it for people who are wise and for people who are not wise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That is why I want so much to tell the good news to you people in the city of Rome also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I am not ashamed of the good news of Jesus Christ. The good news is the power God uses to save every one who believes. The good news was for the Jews first, but also for those who are not Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The good news shows how God puts a person right. God puts a person right when that person believes in his Son and keeps on believing. The holy writings say, ‘A person who is put right because he believes, will live for ever.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">God is angry. He has shown it from heaven. He is angry because of all the bad and wrong things people do. These people hold back God’s truth by the wrong things they do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They know about God. God himself has shown them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">People cannot see that God has power which lasts for ever. They cannot see that he is really God. But ever since he made the world, he has clearly shown this by the things he made. So they cannot say, ‘I did not know about God.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">God has done what the law could not do. The things people did made the law weak. God sent his own Son in a body of man. His body was like the bodies which others use to do wrong things. He sent him because people have done wrong things. And he judged the wrong things people have done in their bodies. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He did this so that we might be good people as the law said we should be. We are good people if we live the way the Spirit wants us to live, not the way our bodies want to live. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">The holy writings also say, ‘I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">In the holy writings it says to Pharaoh, ‘That is why I made you live. I wanted to show my power through you. I wanted people to know about me all over the earth.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So God is kind to any person if he wants to be kind to him. And God makes a man’s heart hard if he wants to do that. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">That means he also called us. He called not only those who are Jews, but also those who are not Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In the book written long ago by the prophet Hosea, God says ‘They were not my people. But I will call them “my people”. I did not love her, but I will call her “the one I love.” </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And how can people tell about him if no one sends them? The holy writings say, ‘How good are the feet of those who bring the good news of peace and happiness.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But they have not all obeyed the good news. It is as Isaiah said it would be, ‘Lord, who has believed what we have told them?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So people believe because they hear. They hear because people tell them about Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I ask, have they not heard? Yes, they have. The holy writings say, ‘Their voice has gone out all over the earth. And their words have gone out all over the world.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I ask, did not the Jews know? First the book of Moses says, ‘I will make you jealous through people who are not a nation like the Jews. I will make you angry through people who do not even know or understand these things.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the book of Isaiah says even stronger words. ‘The people who did not look for me have found me. I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he says about the Jews, ‘All day I held out my hands to a people who did not obey me, who said wrong things against me.’      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So I ask, has God left his people? No, he has not! I myself am a Jew. I was born in Abraham’s family. I belong to the tribe of Benjamin. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God has not left his people whom he knew from the first. Do you not know what the holy writings say about the prophet Elijah? He talked to God against the people of Israel. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, ‘Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have pulled down your holy places. I am the only one that is left, and they are trying to kill me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what did God answer him? He said, ‘I have seven thousand men who have not kneeled down to the idol god Baal.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So now some are left because God was kind to them, and chose them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if it was a gift because he was kind to them, then it was no longer because of the things they did. Or else a gift would no longer be a gift. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So what does that mean? The Jews did not get what they tried to get. Only the people God chose got it. The hearts of the rest of the people became hard. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The holy writings say, ‘God made them dull with sleep. He gave them eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear. They have been like that until today.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David said long ago, ‘May the table where they eat be like a net and like a trap. May it make them fall down. May it punish them. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">So I ask, ‘Have their feet been caught so that they have really fallen down?’ No. But because they began to fall, the people who are not Jews were told how to be saved. That would make the Jews jealous. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The people who are not Jews have been richly blessed because the Jews failed. So it will be even better for them when the Jews no longer fail God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I say this to you who are not Jews. I am an apostle to those who are not Jews, so I think highly of the work I have been sent to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I want the people of my own nation, the Jews, to be jealous. Then I may be able to save some of them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">God turned away from the Jews in order to bring the world back to himself. Then if that is true, when he takes the Jews back to himself, will not that be like making dead people live? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If the first piece of bread is holy, so is all the rest which came from the same bread mix. If the root of a tree is holy, the branches are holy also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Maybe some of the tree’s branches were broken off. And you, a branch from a wild olive tree, were made to grow on the tree among the branches. You then have the good water that comes from the root of the olive tree. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Then you will say, ‘The branches were broken off so that I might be joined to the tree.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That is true. They were broken off because they did not believe. And you have your place only because you believe. So do not be proud, but fear. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">See how kind God is. And see how hard he is. He is hard on those who have fallen. But God is kind to you if you go on following in his ways. If you do not, you also will be broken off. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">In the same way, there is a difference between the woman who is married and the one who is not. The woman who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord. She wants her body and her spirit to be holy. But the married woman thinks about the things of this life. She tries to please her husband. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I say this to help you, not to make it hard for you. I want to show you what is good. I do not want anything to stop you from serving the Lord. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And if a man feels that he is doing the right thing for the woman he is to marry, then let him marry her. That is, if she is no longer young, and if he wants her very much. Then he must do as he thinks best. It is not wrong for him to do it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But the man who has made up his mind not to marry his woman will do well. That is, if he does not have to marry her, and is able to control himself, and if he is sure about it in his own mind. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">We want to say this about ourselves. Our hearts tell us that we have lived the right way in the world, and even more so toward you. We have lived a clean and true life as God wants us to. We have not trusted in the wise things of men, but in the blessing of God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We write you nothing but what you have been reading out to the people, and what you all know. I hope that you will really know what is right even to the end. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">When I wrote to you, I was in great trouble and my heart was very heavy. I cried with many tears. I did not want you to be sad, but I just wanted to let you know that I love you very much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now, about the person who made me sad. It was not only me that he made sad. It was every one of you, in a way. I say ‘in a way’ because I do not want to be too strong in what I say. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That man has been punished enough by what most of you did to him. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">To some it smells like death and brings death to those who are lost. To others it smells like life and it brings life to those who are saved. Who is good enough for such things? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">We are not like some people. They tell God’s message to make money. But we tell it with a true heart just as God told it to us. We tell it as if we stood before God. And we tell it with Christ’s help.      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">All can see that you are a letter from Christ written by us. It is not written in ink, but it is written in the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on pieces of rock, but on the hearts of people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We can say this because we trust in God. And we trust in God because of Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We are not good enough to think we can do anything ourselves. But God makes us able to do it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God has made a new start with people. He has given us a new way back to God. It is not a written law. The Spirit gives it to us. The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The old law that brought death was written on pieces of rock. There was a very bright light when God gave it to the people. The people of Israel could not look at Moses because his face was so bright. And even as they saw it, the light on his face was going away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now bringing the law was bright and wonderful. Will not bringing the Spirit be far more bright and wonderful? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Bringing the law was a wonderful thing even though it brought death. So bringing the good news that people can be put right with God is much more wonderful. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The law was so bright and wonderful at first but has no light now. There is something else that is so much more bright and wonderful. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The one which does not stay alive for ever came first in a great light. Does not the one which does stay alive have a much brighter light? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because we believe this, we do not fear. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We are not like Moses. He put a cloth over his face so that the people of Israel would not see that the light from God was dying. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But their minds were made dull. Even today, when the old law of God is read, it is as if a cloth still covers it. It is Christ who takes the cloth away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yes, even today, when the books of Moses are read, it is as if a cloth covers their hearts and minds. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But when a man turns to the Lord, the cloth is taken away. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, people are set free. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">All of us have no cloth over our faces. People can see that we have some of the bright and wonderful light that the Lord has. And we are becoming brighter and brighter, more and more like him. It is the Lord, the Spirit, who does this.      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">God in his kindness gave us this work. So we do not give up. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">If the good news which we tell is not clear to some people, it is because they are lost. They do not believe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The god of this world has covered their minds so they cannot see. They cannot see with their minds the light of the good news of Christ. They cannot see how bright and wonderful Christ is. He is just like God himself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We do not talk about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus our Lord. And we are your slaves for Jesus’ sake. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God said, ‘Let light shine in the darkness.’ And he has let light shine in our hearts too. He gave us light that shows how bright and wonderful God is. We see this light when we look at the face of Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This is something of great value within us, but we are like pots made of earth and clay. This power is greater than any other power. But it comes from God, not from us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We have much trouble, but we do not give up. We are in hard places, but help always comes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">People trouble us, but God is always with us. We are beaten, but we are not killed. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We always feel as if our body is dying, just as Jesus died. Then the life of Jesus also can be seen in our body. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">While we live we are always ready to die for Jesus. And so the life of Jesus is also seen in our bodies which will die. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, while death is at work in us, life is at work at the same time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We believe the same way as the one who wrote, ‘I believed, and so I talked.’ We also believe, and so we talk to you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We know this. God raised up the Lord Jesus, and he will raise us up also with Jesus. He will bring us all to stand together before God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All this is happening for you so that the blessings of God will reach more people. Then more people will thank God. And this will make God’s name greater. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So we do not give up. Our body gets weak, but our heart gets new strength day after day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The load of trouble we carry now is a little heavy. But this trouble is getting something great and wonderful ready for us which will last for ever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">We are not looking at things that can be seen, but at things that cannot be seen. The things which can be seen last only a little while. But the things which cannot be seen last for ever.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Our body is the house in which our spirit lives here on earth. When that house is destroyed, then God will give us another house. That house is not made by man’s hand. But God made it. It will last for ever in heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">While we are in the house we have now, we are always crying and wanting to have our house from heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When we have moved into it, then we are sure that we will never be left without a house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While we are in this house, we cry and are troubled. It is not that we want to move out of this house, but we want to move into the other one. Then this body which will die will be changed into one which will live. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God is the one who has made us ready for this change. He has already given us the Spirit. This is the first part of what we are to receive, and it proves that we will get more. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So we always feel sure. While we live in our bodies we are not in our house with the Lord. We know that. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We do not see these things, but we believe them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We feel sure that we will want to leave this body and go to live with the Lord. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">No, we are not praising ourselves again. But we are telling you this so that you may really be proud of us. Then you will be ready to answer people who are proud of themselves. They are proud of the things which can be seen. But in their hearts they have nothing to be proud of. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If we are crazy, it is for God’s sake. If we are right in our minds, it is for your sakes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The love of Christ makes us do what we do to win men. We believe that one man died for all people. [To God] it is as if we all died with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He died for all, so that those who live would not live to please themselves. But they should live to please him who gave his life for them and rose again from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So then we no longer know people by what we see on the outside. There was a time when we knew Christ that way, but now we do not know him that way any longer. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So, if any man belongs to Christ, he is a new person. His old life has gone. You see, he has begun a new life. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But it is God who has done all this. He sent Christ to make peace with us and to bring us back to himself. Now he has given us the work of bringing other people back to God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">God was in Christ. He brought the world back to himself. He forgave them for the wrong things they had done. And he gave us the message that will bring people back to himself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So we are messengers for Christ. God is using us to call people. So we are standing here for Christ and begging people, ‘Come back to God!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Christ did no wrong thing. But for our sake God put the blame for our wrong ways on Christ. So now God sees us as good, because we are in Christ.      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">We work with God. So we beg you, do not take God’s blessing and get nothing from it. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">You comforted him, and that comforted us. He told us that you wanted very much to see us. He told us that you were very sorry for what you had done. He told us that you want to stand with me. So now I am even more happy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">
        <STYLE fs="super"> (8-9) </STYLE>I know that what I wrote in my letter made you sad. But I am not sorry I wrote it. Perhaps I was sorry at first, but now I am glad I sent it. I see the letter made you sad for a while. I do not like to make you sad, but I am glad that it made you sad and made you turn from your wrong ways. You took it all as from God. So then, we did not really hurt you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When we are sad the way God wants us to be, we turn from our wrong ways. Then we are saved and we can never be sorry about that. But the sorrow of the world brings death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">See what happened. When you were sad, the way God wanted you to be, then you tried to do the right thing. You wanted to free yourself from wrong. You hated what is wrong. You were afraid. You wanted very much to do what is right. You stood for the right. You punished wrong doing. In every way you showed that you did right in this matter. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the man who did wrong. And it was not for the sake of the man who had the wrong done to him. But I wrote so that you would see for yourselves, in the sight of God, how much we care for you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And so we have been comforted. Besides this, we were even more happy to see how happy Titus was. All of you really made his heart glad. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I told him how proud I was of you. And really, I had nothing to be ashamed of. Everything we have said to you has been true. So also, what we told Titus about you proved true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He loves you even more when he remembers how you all obeyed him. You feared and trembled. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I am glad that I can always trust you.      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My brothers, let me tell you how God has blessed the churches in Macedonia. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They are being tested by much trouble. But they are always very happy. And they are very poor. Because of these two things, they give to others as if they were rich. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I can tell you because I saw it myself. They gave as much as they could and even more than that. They did it all because they wanted to. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They begged us to let them give something to help God’s people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they did more than we thought they would do. First, they gave themselves to the Lord and to us, because we were doing God’s work. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That is why we asked Titus to see about your gift. He started you off in your giving. And so he is the one to see that you finish it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We remember how well you do in everything. You do well in believing, in talking, in knowing things, in trying your best, and in the way you love us. So now, do well in giving this gift. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I am not saying that you must do it. But I want to prove how strong your love is. That is why I have told you how other people show their love. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You know how much love our Lord Jesus Christ had. He was rich, but he became poor for your sakes. Because he became poor, you can become rich. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I tell you what I think. It is best for you to finish what you started a year ago. You were the first to think of helping, and you started to give money. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So now, finish doing it. You wanted to do it, so now finish it. Give as much as you can. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If a man wants to give, he is judged by what he has to give. He is not judged by what he cannot give. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I do not want it to be easy for others and hard for you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I want it to be equal for everyone. Right now, you have plenty and are able to help them. Another time, when they have plenty, they will help you when you need it. In that way things will be equal. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The holy writings say, ‘The person who had plenty did not have too much. And the person who did not have much, had enough.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I thank God that he has put the same care for you into the heart of Titus that I have. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He was glad to go when I asked him, but he is also coming to you because he himself wants to come. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">We are sending another brother with him. This brother has a good name in all the churches because he tells the good news. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Not only that, but the churches have chosen him to travel with us as we take care of this gift. We are doing this so that the Lord will be praised. We want to help others. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We do not want anyone to say that we have not done the right thing. So we are taking care of this big gift in the right way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">We want to do what the Lord says is right, but also what people say is right. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And we are also sending another brother with them. We have found him to be glad to help us in many matters, many times. And now he is much more glad to help because he trusts you very much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I want to say this. Titus is my close friend and he works with me. And about our other brothers, they have been sent by the churches. They bring praise to Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now then, prove that you love them. Prove that what we have said about you is true. Then the churches will know it.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Of course, I really do not need to write to you about the money to be given to God’s people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I know that you wanted to help. I am proud to tell the people of Macedonia about you. I tell them, ‘The people in Greece have been ready for a year.’ And what you did has made most of them want to do something too. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But I am sending these brothers so that what we have said about you will be true in this way. I want you to be really ready with the gift, just as I said you would be. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If some men from Macedonia come with me and see that you are not ready, then we will be ashamed, and you too. We will be ashamed that we were so sure. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So I thought it would be good to send these brothers to you first. They will get this gift ready which you promised. Then it will be ready like a gift, and not as if you were forced to give it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Here is something to remember. ‘The man who plants a little bit will get only a little from it. The man who plants much will get much from it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Everyone should give what he wants in his heart to give. He should be glad to give it, and should not give it because he was forced to give. ‘God loves a person who gives gladly.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God is able to give you even more blessings than you need. In all things you will always have all you need for yourselves, and you will have enough to help all others. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The holy writings say, ‘A good man gives away many things. He gives to the poor people. He will always be a good man in the sight of God.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God is the one who gives seed to plant and bread to eat. He will give you enough to give away and will make it become more and more. Of the good things you do he will give you a big harvest. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You will become rich in every way. And then you will have enough to give plenty to all people. And many people will thank God for your gifts which we will bring them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This gift of money will help to give God’s people what they need. It will also make many people thank God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This gift will prove something to them. They will praise God because you obey the good news of Christ. They will praise God because you have given this gift to help them and all the others. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They will love you and talk to God about you, because God has blessed you very much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thank God for his gift so great that no words can ever tell it all!      </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I, Paul, beg you to do something since you know that Christ was kind and gentle. You say I am weak when I am face to face with you, but when I am not with you, then I speak to you with hard words. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I beg you, do not force me to talk hard words when I come. I have made up my mind to talk hard words against some people. They think we are living for the things in this world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Of course we are living in bodies made for this world. But we are not fighting for the things in this world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We do not use the things of this world in our fighting, but we use the power of God. This power can break down the walls where the enemy hides. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We can break down what people think and every big idea that tries to stop people from knowing God. And we can make every thought a prisoner to obey Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Only when you all obey, then we are ready to punish anyone who will not obey. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Surely you can see this. If one person is sure that he belongs to Christ, then he should see that we too belong to Christ just as he does. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Lord gave us power to build you up, not to break you down. Maybe I talk about it too much. But I feel I am right in talking about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I do not want you to think that I am trying to make you afraid by my letters. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Some people say, ‘Paul’s letters make us listen. They are strong. But he himself is weak and what he says is not worth listening to.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">People like that should know this. When we come we will do what we have said in our letters. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We do not want to be like those people who praise themselves. They measure themselves by their own ideas, and look at themselves to see how good they are. When they do that, they are foolish! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We will not talk of things we did not do. No, we will only be proud of those things which God has given us to do. And he has sent us even as far as you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We are not going farther than we should when we come to you. We were the first to come all the way to you with the good news of Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We will not be proud of other men’s work which we did not do. We hope that you will believe more strongly, so that we can do more work among you, as God gives it to us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then we hope to tell the good news in places far beyond you. We will not be proud of the work given to someone else to do–work that was done before we got there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The holy writings say that the person who is proud should be proud only of the Lord. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A man who praises himself is not a man who is good. The man who is really good is the man whom the Lord praises.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I want to say something a little bit foolish. But please listen to me! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I love you as God loves you. I see you as a woman who has not been married and I am giving you to be the wife of a husband. That husband is Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the snake fooled Eve by his trick. And I am afraid that your minds will be drawn away from a clean, pure love of Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You listen to a new man when he comes to tell you about a different Jesus, which is not the one we told you about. And when you receive a spirit and a message which are not the ones you had first, then you listen too much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But I really do not think that the chief apostles are any better than I am! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Maybe I am not a good talker, but I surely know what I am talking about! Yes, we made this plain to you in every way in all things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Perhaps it was wrong for me to bring myself down in order to raise you up. Do you think that? Was it wrong for me to tell you the good news without pay? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I took pay from other churches. I made them poor so that I might help you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When I was with you and needed money, I did not make any of you pay me. When the brothers came from Macedonia, they gave me what I needed. So I was not, and I will not be, any trouble to you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Surely, the true word of Christ is in me. I will never stop being proud of this anywhere in Achaia [Greece]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why is this? Is it because I do not love you? God knows that I love you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will keep on doing what I am doing now. Some teachers are praising themselves. They say they are like us. By doing this I prove they are not like us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Men like that are not true apostles. They work to fool people. They try to make themselves look like apostles of Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am not surprised. Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So it is not strange if his workers also try to make themselves look like God’s workers who do right. They will come to an end like the work they do! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I say again, no one should think that I am foolish. But if you do, then please listen to me as if I were foolish. I also want to do a little talking about myself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I am not talking like the Lord when I say this. It seems foolish to say so much about myself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Many people talk about themselves in the world. So I will too. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Since you are wise, you still agree to listen to foolish people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You listen to a man even if he makes slaves of you, even if he spends all your money, even if he catches you in a trap, even if he is proud of himself, even if he slaps you in the face. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I am ashamed, but I must say that we were too weak to be like that! Anything that others want to be proud of, I can talk about too. And yet it is really foolish to do so. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Are they Hebrew people? So am I. Are they Israel’s people? So am I. Is Abraham their father? He is mine too. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Are they workers for Christ? (I talk like one who is not in his right mind.) I am a better worker. I have worked much harder. I have been in prison more often. I have been beaten many, many times. Often I have almost died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Jewish leaders five times gave me thirty nine strikes with the rope. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Three times people beat me with sticks, and once they threw rocks at me. Three times I was in a boat when it broke in the sea. I have been in the water all one night and day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have travelled much. I have crossed bad rivers. I have gone where men might steal my things. The Jews and those who are not Jews have troubled me. I have been in hard places in the city. I have had hard times in the desert. I have had hard times on the water. I have had hard times among those who should have been my brothers and were not. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I have worked hard. I have been tired out. I have often had no sleep at night. I have been hungry and thirsty. I have often had nothing to eat. I have been cold and did not have enough clothes to wear. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Beside all other things, my heart is troubled about the churches. That is a load I carry every day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When anyone is weak, I am weak too. When anyone is made to fall away, my heart burns within me </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">If I must talk about myself, I will talk about the things that show I am weak. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">God knows I am not telling lies. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and he is to be praised forever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">In the city of Damascus a man ruled for king Aretas. He had the gates of the city guarded because he wanted to catch me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But I sat in a basket. Then it was put out through a window in the wall and was let down. And so I got away from him.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I must talk about myself even though it does no good. I will talk about visions and things which the Lord has shown me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I know a Christian man. Fourteen years ago he was taken up into the place where God lives. I do not know if he was in his body when he went or not. God knows if he was. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I do know this. He was taken up into the place where God lives. And again I say, I do not know if he was in his body or not. God knows if he was. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This man heard things which cannot be told. No person on earth can speak them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I will talk about such a man. But I will not talk about myself. If I do talk, it will be about the ways I am weak. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now if I wanted to talk about myself, I would not be foolish. I would be telling the truth. But I will not say any more. This is why: I do not want anyone to think I am better than what he sees I am, or hears me teach. I want him to judge me only by what he can see in me and by what I say. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because the things God showed me were so wonderful, I might have become too proud of myself. But something happened and stopped that. It was like a thorn in me. It came from Satan [the devil] to trouble me. It came to stop me from being too proud. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I begged the Lord three times that this trouble might leave me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But he said to me, ‘My kindness and strength is enough for you. When you are weak, my power is strong.’ So then, I am very glad to talk about how weak I am so that the power of Christ may live in me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So then, for the sake of Christ I am glad to be weak, to have people say wrong things about me, to be poor, to have people trouble me, and to have hard times. When I am weak, that is the time I am really strong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now I have been acting like one with no sense, but you have made me do it. You should have been talking about the good things I have done. The very best apostles are not one bit better than I am, even though I am nothing at all. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There are signs that show a true apostle. I did all these things when I was among you. There were signs, wonderful works, and other big works which I did. You saw the power of God, even though I was being tested. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In what way did you not receive as much as the other churches? Only this! I did not trouble you to pay me. Forgive me for the wrong I did you! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now, I am ready to come to you for the third time. And I will not trouble you to pay me. I do not want what belongs to you, but I want you. The children should not save up for their parents, but the parents should do it for their children. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For my part, I am glad to spend what I have, and to spend myself for the sake of your souls. But it seems to me that the more I love you the less you love me! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">All right then, I did not trouble you for any money. But some of you think that I have been mean and played a trick on you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Did I send anyone to you to get something for myself? No! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I asked Titus to go and I sent our brother with him. Did Titus get anything for himself? No! Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Am I saying all this just to you? Are we just trying to make ourselves look right to you? No, we say this before God and in Christ. And my dear people, I have done it all to make you better Christians. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I want to be pleased with you when I come. But I am afraid I will not be. And I am afraid that you will not be pleased with me. I fear that I may find quarrelling, jealousy, anger, and that I will find you are enemies to each other, that you are spoiling each other’s names, that you are telling stories about each other, that you are proud and do not obey rulers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And I am afraid that when I come my God will make me ashamed of you. I am afraid that my heart will be very sad about you. Many have been doing wrong things for a long time. Many have not turned away from their dirty ways, their wrong use of sex, and the things they should be ashamed of.      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">This will be the proof you want that Christ speaks through me. Christ is not weak when he deals with you. No, he shows his power among you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It is true that he was weak when he died on a cross. But now he is alive by the power of God. We are weak as he was, but we will also be alive as he is by the power God has. You will see this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Look at yourselves and check to see if you still believe. Test yourselves. Do you not know Jesus Christ is in you? If he is not in you, you do not pass the test. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I hope you will know that we pass the test. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We ask God to help you that you will do nothing wrong. That is not to show you that we pass the test. We want you to do what is right even if we do not pass the test. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">After all, we have no power to work against what is true, but only for the truth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We are glad to be weak, if you are made strong. And we ask God for this too, that you may become perfect. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That is why I am writing these things to you the way I am, before I reach you. Then, when I come to you, I do not want to be hard on you. I do not want to use the power which the Lord has given me. He gave it to me to help to make you better Christians, not to break you down. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, my brothers, in closing I say, ‘Goodbye.’ Be what you should be. Listen to what I say. Be good to each other. Agree with one another. Live in peace with one another. And the God who gives love and peace will be with you. </VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem again. This time I went with Barnabas and I took Titus with me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God showed me that I should go. And I told them about the good news which I tell to people who are not Jews. I told those who seemed to be church leaders when I was alone with them. I did not want my work to come to nothing–the work I had done or the work I was doing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Titus was with me. He was not a Jew, but they did not force him to be circumcised [have the mark of a Jew made on his body]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But some men got in who were not true brothers. They came in secretly to spy on us to find out things about us. They did not want us to be free the way Christ Jesus has made us free. But they wanted to make us obey the old laws again [which were given to Moses by God]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But we did not let them tell us what to do, no, not even for one minute. In that way the real good news will be yours always. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Those men who seemed to be leaders did not teach me anything new. It does not matter to me who they were. God does not love some people more than others. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">No, the leaders saw that God called me to take the good news to those who are not circumcised [not Jews], just as he called Peter to take the good news to those who are circumcised [Jews]. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The same God who made Peter an apostle to the Jews made me an apostle to those who are not Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The leaders saw that God had blessed me. James, Peter, and John seemed to be leaders in the church. They saw that God had blessed me. So they accepted Barnabas and me as fellow workers. They agreed that we should go to the people who were not Jews and they themselves would go to the Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">One thing they asked us to do was to help the poor Christians. I was very glad to do this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">One day Peter came to the city of Antioch. Then I had to tell him face to face that he had done wrong. He really was wrong! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Here is what happened. Peter ate with those who were not Jews. Then some men came whom James had sent. When they came he stopped eating with those who were not Jews. He was afraid of what the Jews might think. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">All the other Jewish Christians did the same as Peter did. They acted as if it was not right to eat with those who were not Jews. Even Barnabas did the same. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I saw they were not doing right. They were not obeying the true teaching of the good news. So I said to Peter in front of them all, ‘You are a Jew. But you live the way people do who are not Jews. How then can you force those who are not Jews to live the way the Jews do?’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We ourselves were born Jews. We are not of those who still follow wrong ways, those who are not Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yet we know that God does not call a man good because he tries to obey the law of the Jews. But we know that God puts a man right because he believes in Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Jesus Christ. And we are put right with God because we believe in Christ and not because we obey the law. No person will ever be called good by God just because he tries to obey the law of the Jews. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">We came to Christ to be put right with God. That showed us how much we had been bad men. Was it Christ who made us bad men? No, surely not! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If I build up again what I once broke down, I do wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Through the law I died. Now the law has no power over me so that I may live for God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I died when Christ died on a cross. I do not live now, but Christ lives in me. Now while I still live in my body, I live by believing in the Son of God. He loved me and gave himself for me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So I do not make the love of God useless. But if a person can be made good by the law, then Christ died for nothing.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">O you Galatians, have you no sense at all? Who has fooled you? You knew, just as if you had seen him with your own eyes, that Jesus Christ was killed on a cross. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here is one thing I want to ask you. You received the Holy Spirit. Was that because you obeyed the law [given to the Jews by Moses]? No, it was because you heard God’s word and believed it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Have you no sense at all? You began living your new life by the power of the Spirit. And are you now trying to finish living it by your own power [to keep the law]? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So many things happened to you. Was it all for nothing? Surely it was not for nothing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God gives you the Spirit. He does wonderful works among you. Does he do this because you obey the law? No, he does it because you heard the word of God and believed it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So it was with Abraham. The holy writings say ‘He believed God, and that was why God called him a good man.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You see then, the people who believe God are children of Abraham. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The holy writings say that he will put people right with himself if they believe him, even those who are not Jews. It was written down before God did it. The holy writings told the good news to Abraham ahead of time. It said, ‘God will make you a blessing to all nations and people.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Abraham believed God and was blessed. And so those who believe God are blessed too, along with him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A curse is on all people who are trying to become good by obeying the law. The holy writings say, ‘Everyone is cursed who does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the law and do it.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, you can see this. No man is called a good man by God because he obeys the law. The holy writings say, ‘Those who are right with God shall live by faith.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The law does not ask people to believe. It says, ‘He who obeys the laws will live because of them.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ has saved us from the curse which the law put on us. He took the curse on himself. It should have been on us. The holy writings say, ‘A curse be on everyone who hangs on a tree!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Christ Jesus did this so that those who are not Jews will have the blessing which Abraham had. He did this so that when we believe, we will receive the Spirit who was promised to us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">My brothers, it is the same as when a man makes a promise. He makes it good and strong. Then no one can break it or add anything to it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God made his promises to Abraham and to his Son. The promise does not have the words, ‘and to his sons,’ for that means many sons. But it says, ‘and to his Son,’ and that Son is Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Here is what I mean. The law was given [to Moses] four hundred and thirty years after God gave that promise to Abraham. But it cannot break the strong promise which God made. And the law cannot change God’s promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do we get what God has promised us by obeying the law? If we do, then we are not getting it by his promise. But God gave it to Abraham by his promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then was the law made? God gave it after he made the promise, because so many people were doing what was wrong. The law was to be in power only until the Son came, the one to whom the promise was made. The law was handed down by God’s angels with the help of a middle man. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To need the help of a middle man there must be more than one person making the agreement. But God is the only one who made the promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law against the promises of God? No, it is not! If a law had been given that could give people life, then surely people would have become good people by the law. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the holy writings say it is like this. The whole world is in prison, kept there by the wrong things they have done. This was done so that people who believe in Jesus Christ would have the blessing. This blessing was promised to those who believe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Before one came for us to believe in, the law held us in prison like slaves. We were kept there until the one to believe in should come. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The law watched over us, as if we were children, until Christ came. Then God would put us right with himself through faith in Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now that one has come for us to believe in, the law does not watch over us any longer. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You are all God’s children because you have believed in Christ Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">All of you who have been baptised into Christ have taken Christ as your own. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is no longer any difference between a Jew and one who is not a Jew; between a slave and a free man; between a man and a woman. When you are in the body of Christ Jesus, you are all alike. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If you belong to Christ, you are Abraham’s children. And if you are Abraham’s children, you will receive the blessing that God has promised.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Here is what I mean. When a man dies, his son is to receive his property. As long as the son is not grown up, he cannot have it. He has no more right than a servant, even though he really owns all the property. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He still has people who take care of him and he must obey them until the time set by his father. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So it is with us. Before we were grown up, we were like servants. We were just beginning to learn about the things of this world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the right time came, God sent his Son to make us free. He was born by a woman during the time when men had to obey the law. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God sent him to set the people free who were under the law. God sent him so that we would receive our rights as sons of God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts. The Spirit calls out, ‘Father!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then, because of what God has done, you are no longer a slave but you are a son. And because you are a son, you will receive what he promised. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At first, you did not know God. At that time you obeyed things which are not real gods. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now you know God. That is, God knows you. Then why do you turn to things that are weak and can do no good? Do you want to obey them again? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You have holy days, holy months, holy seasons, and holy years. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I fear that all my work for you has been for nothing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My brothers, I beg you, be like me because I am like you. You did me no wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You know that I was sick when I first told you the good news. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My sickness troubled you. But you did not think wrongly of me or turn away from me. You received me as if I were an angel from God, as if I were Christ Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Why are you not happy any more? I saw myself that you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if you could do such a thing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you hate me because I tell you the truth? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Other people are trying hard to get you on their side. But they do not mean to help you. They want to get you away from Christ so that you will listen to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of course, it is good if someone tries to help you, but only if it is for a good reason. It is always good, not only when I am with you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My dear children, I feel pain for you again, like a mother when her child is being born. I will feel pain until Christ lives in your heart. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I wish I could be with you now, and not have to talk this way. But I am troubled about you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you people that want the law to control you, why do you not listen to the law? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The holy writings say that Abraham had two sons. One was the son of the slave woman. The other one was the son of the free woman. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The child of the slave woman was born as any child is born. But the child of the free woman was born because God promised he would be born. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">These things have another meaning. These two women are like two agreements. One agreement came from Mount Sinai. The children are born slaves. That agreement is like Hagar. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So Hagar means Mount Sinai in the country of Arabia. She is like the city of Jerusalem today, because Jerusalem is a slave and her children are too. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the city of Jerusalem in heaven is free, and that is our mother. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The holy writings say, ‘The woman who has not had a child, be happy! You who do not feel the pain of bearing a child, open your mouth and shout. The woman who is left alone has more children than the woman who has a husband!’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">My brothers, we are like Isaac. We are born because God made a promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abraham’s child who was born as any child is born, troubled the other child who was born by the Spirit. It is that way today. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But what does the holy writings say? They says, ‘Put away the slave woman and her son. The son of the slave woman will have nothing when the father dies. The son of the free woman will have everything.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So, my brothers, we are not the children of the slave woman, but we are children of the free woman.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Christ has made us really free. So, stay free! Do not let yourselves be made slaves again. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I, Paul, say to you again that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ is no help to you at all. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Again I say to every man who is circumcised, he must obey all the law. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some of you are trying to obey the law, so that God will call you good. If you do this, you have been cut off from Christ. You have lost the blessing of God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But we hope to be made right by believing in Christ. The Spirit helps us to do this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So if a man belongs to Christ Jesus, it does not matter if he is circumcised or not. He must show by his love that he believes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You were doing well. Who stopped you from doing what is right? </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">My brothers, am I still telling people to be circumcised? If I am, why are people still troubling me? If it were true, the cross of Christ, which they do not like, has lost its power. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">These teachers are troubling your minds. How I wish they would cut themselves off! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not take that to mean that you can do as you please. But work for each other because you love each other. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This one law is the whole law: ‘Love your neighbour as you love yourself.’ </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">People want to do wrong things that the Spirit does not want them to do. And the Spirit wants people to do things they do not want to do. The Spirit and the wrong things you want to do are against each other, so that you do not do what you yourself want to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If you do what the Spirit wants you to do, then you will be free from the law. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">He did this to show us in all times to come how much he can bless people and how kind he is. It was Jesus Christ who brought this kindness to us. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">You were not saved by trying to do what the law says. So no one can be proud about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God has made us. In Jesus Christ God made us so that we can do good things. He planned that we should live that way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So remember that you were not born Jews. (They call you ‘The Uncircumcised’). </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Remember you did not know Christ at that time. You were far away from the people of Israel. You had no part in the agreements which God promised to them. You had no hope and you were without God in this world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At one time you were far away, but now you have been brought near to God by the blood [death] of Jesus Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Christ has made peace between us. He has brought both Jews and non-Jews together into one people. He has broken down the wall that divided us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In his own body Christ made an end of the law and its rules. He did this so that in him two peoples could become one. In this way, he made peace between us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He did this so that by the cross he might bring both kinds of people back to God in one body. And by the cross he has stopped our hating each other. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He came and said that there is now peace. There is peace for you who were far away from God and for those who were near. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because of what Christ has done, we can come to the Father by one Spirit. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So then you are no longer strangers or people far away. But you live with God’s people and belong to God’s family. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God’s family is like a house and you are part of the building. The apostles and prophets are like the lower walls of the house and you are the building on this foundation. Jesus Christ is the big stone at the corner. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He is the one who holds the whole house together, and it becomes a holy house belonging to the Lord. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He must not get drunk. He must not fight. But he must be kind. He must not quarrel. He must not love money. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">If a man does not know how to lead his own family, how can he take care of the church of God? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A church leader must not be a new believer. If he were a new believer, he might become proud and set himself up like the devil did. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">People who are not church people must also speak well of a church leader, so that he will not fall into the devil’s trap. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In the same way, the leader’s helpers must be men whom people respect. They must not say one thing one time and something different another time. They must not drink too much wine. They must not try to get rich in wrong ways. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They must know God’s plan and what we believe. They must do only what they know is right. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Try these men first. Then let them help the church people if they have done nothing wrong. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then if I do not come right away, you will know what people should do in God’s family. This family is the church of the living God. The church people hold what is true and keeps it strong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God’s plan is very great as we all know. Here it is: we saw God as a man; God’s Spirit proved he was right; angels saw him; the nations were told about him; people of the world believed in him; God took him up into heaven.      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They will teach people that they should not marry. They will teach them not to eat some kinds of food. God made the food and he wanted people to take it and thank him for it. Those who believe and know what is true do this. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Everything that God has made for food is good. It is all right to eat it if people thank God for it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God’s word and asking him to bless the food makes it good for people to eat. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">‘To make the body strong helps a little, but the things of God help us in all ways. The things of God promise us life now and life in heaven.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">These are true words and everyone should believe them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That is why we work hard and put up with troubles. We trust in the living God who came to save all people. He makes a way for those who believe in him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Tell people these things and teach them to do them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Do not let anyone despise you because you are a young man. Show those who believe how they should live. Show them by the way you talk. Show them by the way you live. Show them by the way you love. Show them how to believe by the way you believe. Show them how to live a clean life by the way you live a clean life. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">If they have children or grandchildren, they should learn that the first place to do God’s work is in the home to help their own family. They should help their parents because their parents have helped them. This will please God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A widow who has no one to help her, and is alone, trusts in God. Day and night she talks to God and asks him for the things she needs. </VERS>

Has she washed the feet of God’s people? Has she helped people who were in trouble? Has she done every kind of good thing to help people? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But do not choose young women. When they begin to love other things more than Christ, they will want to marry again. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Not only that, but they also become lazy. They walk about going from house to house. Not only are they lazy but they talk too much and tell stories about people. They tell things they should not tell. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Do any Christians have in their families women whose husbands are dead? If they do, they should help them. The church people should not have to care for them. Then the church can help the women who have no one to help them. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">So do not be ashamed to talk about our Lord. And do not be ashamed of me. I am his prisoner. Be patient in your trouble also, because you tell the good news. God will give you the power to do it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God saved us and called us to live a holy life. He did not do it because of the good things we have done. He did it because he himself planned to do it, and wanted to do it. That was the blessing he gave us in Christ Jesus. He had this plan before he made the world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But now he has made it real through the coming of Jesus Christ who saves. He has put death out of the way. He has shown people can have everlasting life by telling them the good news. </VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="56" bname="Titus" bsname="Tit">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I am Paul. I am a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I have been sent to God’s chosen people so that they will believe and know what is true. This will make them more like God wants them to be. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I do this work because then they can hope to have everlasting life. God does not fool people. He promised everlasting life before he made the world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And at the right time he sent men to tell people his word. God, who saves us, trusted me and told me to tell that word. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Titus, I send greetings to you. You are my true son because you believe the same way I do. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour bless you, and be kind to you, and give you peace. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This is why I left you in the island of Crete. I want you to finish putting things in order. And I want you to choose leaders among the church people in every city as I told you to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A leader must be a good man, that no one can blame for doing anything wrong. He must have only one wife. His children should believe. They must not live wrong lives. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The church leader must be a good man because he looks after God’s work. He must not want his own way. He must not get angry or get drunk. He must not fight. He must not try to get rich in wrong ways. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he must be kind to strangers in his house. He must love what is good. He must be wise. He must do what is right. He must live a holy life. He must know how to control himself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He must hold strongly to the true message which he has been taught. Then he will be able to teach other people what is right. And he will be able to answer people who talk against it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">There are many people who do not obey God’s truth. They talk about things that do no good, and they fool people by it. The Jewish leaders do this very much. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You must put a stop to their talking. They stop whole families from believing in Christ because they teach things which they have no right to teach. They teach because they want to get paid for it, even though it is wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">One of their own prophets said, ‘The people of Crete are always telling lies. They are like wild, bad animals. They are lazy and want to eat too much.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">What he said is true. You must tell them that they are wrong. Tell them to stop it. They must believe what is true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They must not use the old Jewish stories. They must not use the rules which were made by men who do not believe what is true. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All things are clean to those who have a clean mind. But nothing is clean to those who do wrong things and do not believe. Their minds and their hearts are full of wrong things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They say that they know God. But what they do shows that they do not know him. They live in a way that God hates. They do not obey. They can do nothing that is good.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But as for you, Titus, you must teach what is right. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Tell the older men that they must not drink too much wine. They must be men whom people respect. They must be wise. They must believe what is true. They must be loving and patient. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Tell the older women also that they must live like Christians. They must not tell lies about anyone. They must not drink much wine. They must teach what is good. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They must teach the young women to love their husbands and their children. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They must teach young women to have good sense, to live a clean life, to care for their homes, to be kind, and to obey their husbands. Then people cannot say wrong things about God’s word. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Also tell the young men to have good sense. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Titus, show them what they should do in all matters by the good things you do. Do not mix your teaching with things that are not true. Teach in such a way that people will respect you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be sure that what you say is true, so that no one can say anything against it. Then anyone who is against us will be made ashamed because he can find nothing wrong to say about us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Tell servants to obey their master in everything. Tell them to please them and not talk back to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They must not steal, but be very honest so the person they work for can trust them. In all things they must show that the teaching about God our Saviour is good. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God’s loving kindness has come. It is through that blessing that all men are saved. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It teaches us to say no to the things that are not true of God, and to the things of this world. It teaches us to use good sense, to do what is right, and to please God while we live in this world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">All this is while we wait and hope to see the one who brings blessing. We are waiting for our great God to come in Jesus Christ. He is the One who will save us. He is wonderful! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Christ gave himself for us so that he might make us free from all that is wrong. He gave himself to make us into clean people who belong to him and want to do good. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Talk about these things. Tell people they must do them. And use all your power to stop people if they are doing wrong. Do not let anyone despise you.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Tell the people again to obey their rulers and governments, and to do what they tell them to do. Tell them to be ready to do any honest work. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They must not say wrong things about anyone. They must not quarrel. They must be kind and polite to everyone. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There was a time when we ourselves did not have understanding. We did not obey God. We were fooled by people. We did many wrong things we wanted to do. We did what we pleased. We lived our days in planning to do wrong things and wanting what other people had. People hated us, and we hated each other. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God who saves us showed how kind and good he is. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We were not saved by any good things we did ourselves, but he saved us because he is so kind. He washed us clean. We were born again as a new person. The Holy Spirit has made us new. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God is rich. And he gave the Holy Spirit to us because of Jesus Christ our Saviour. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He did this so that we can be put right with God, by his kindness. He did this so that we can become his children. So now we can look forward to everlasting life. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">These are true words. And I want you to tell the people these things. Then those who have believed God will try to do good things. These things are right and help people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have nothing to do with: foolish quarrels; lists of people who lived long ago; those who make trouble and argue about the law. These things do not help people and are good for nothing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Talk to any who do not believe right. Talk to them about it once or twice. Then, if they will not listen, have nothing more to do with them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You know that such people are wrong and what they do is wrong. They themselves know that they are wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at the city of Nicopolis. I have planned to stay there while it is the cold time of the year. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Do your best to send Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos on their way. Give them all they need. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Our people should learn to spend their time in doing good things to help people who are poor. In that way, our people will not waste their time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All those who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who believe as we do and who love us. God bless you all.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="57" bname="Philemon" bsname="Phm">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I am Paul. I am in prison because I belong to Christ Jesus. Our brother Timothy and I send greetings to you, Philemon. We love you very much. And you work with us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We also send greetings to our sister Apphia; to Archippus who is worker in God’s army as we are; and to the people who meet as a church in your house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you in their kindness and give you peace. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I always thank my God when I talk to him about you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I have heard that you love all of God’s people and that you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You believe as I do. I ask God that he may help you to know more and more of every good thing that we have in Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">My brother, your love made me very glad and it comforted my heart. I know that God’s people were glad because you loved them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Because I am Christ’s apostle, I could tell you what you must do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But because I love you, I would rather not tell you, but ask you to do this for me. I, Paul, am an old man and now I am in prison because I belong to Jesus Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am asking you to do something for my son. He became a Christian here in prison. This son is Onesimus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">At one time he was no help to you. But now he is a big help to you and to me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I am sending him back to you and it is like sending you my own heart. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I would like to keep him with me. He can help me while I am in prison for the sake of the good news. That would be just as if you were here to help me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I did not want to do anything unless you agreed. I did not want you to do this because you were forced to do it, but because you wanted to do it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Maybe it was good for him to be away from you for a while. Now you will have him with you for ever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now he is not like a slave who must work for you. He is better than a slave. He is a Christian brother and you will love him. I love him very much. But you will love him even more because he belongs to you and he is a Christian. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So if you think of me as a real friend, take him back just as you would take me back. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If he has done you any wrong, or if he owes you a debt, then ask me to pay it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it. I do not need to tell you that you have your life because of what I did for you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yes, my brother, give me some help in the Lord. Make me happy in Christ. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I believe that you will do what I ask you to do. And so I am writing to you. I know that you will do even more than I ask you to do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At the same time, please make a place ready for me to stay. I know you are asking God to set me free, so I believe he will let me come to see you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Epaphras is in prison with me for the sake of Christ Jesus. He sends greetings to you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke are working with me. They all send greetings too. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">May the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen! May it be so!</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="58" bname="Hebrews" bsname="Heb">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Long ago, God talked to our fathers through the prophets. He talked many times and in many ways. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In these last days, he talked to us through his Son. God chose him to be the one to whom he would give all things. God also made the world by this Son. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He shines as bright as God. He is just like God himself. He holds up the world by the power of his word. He made people clean from their wrong ways. Then he sat down beside God in heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He is much greater than the angels because God has given him a much better name than theirs. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Did God ever say to any of the angels, ‘You are my Son, and I am your Father today’? Did God ever say to an angel, ‘I will be your Father and you will be my Son’? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When God brings his first-born Son into the world, he says, ‘All of God’s angels must worship him.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Here is what he says about the angels: ‘God makes his angels to be like the winds. He makes his helpers to be like flames of fire.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But here is what God says about his Son: ‘O God, you will sit and rule for ever. You will rule in the right way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You have loved what is good and you have hated what is wrong. That is why God has poured out happiness on you, more than on those who are with you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He also said, ‘Lord, you made the world in the beginning. The sky was made by your hands. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These things will come to an end, but you will live on. They will all wear out like clothes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You will fold up the world and the sky as if they were a blanket. They will not stay as they are now. But you will always be as you are now. The years of your life will never end.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But did God ever say to any of the angels, ‘Sit down beside me until I put your enemies under you’? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are not all the angels spirits that help? They are sent out to help the people who will be saved.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">That is why we must listen very carefully to the things we have heard. We must never forget them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">What the angels said proved to be true. Every one who broke the law, and who did not obey it, was punished as he should be punished. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If that is so, then we will not get away without being punished. We will be punished if we forget or throw away this wonderful way to be saved. It was the Lord who first told people how to be saved. Then those who heard him told us the true way. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God also proved that it was the true way. He gave signs. He did things that surprised people. He did many things by his power. He gave the gifts of the Holy Spirit to people just as he wanted to. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God did not put the next world under angels for them to rule over. That is the world we are talking about. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In one place the holy writings say, ‘What is man and why do you think about him? What is the Son of a Man and why do you care about him? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You made him lower than angels for a little while. But then you made him very great and high. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You put everything under him for him to rule over.’ When God gave him the right to rule over everything, nothing was left out which he did not have the right to rule. But we do not yet see him ruling over everything. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we do see Jesus! For a short time he was lower than the angels. Because he died, we see him made great and high. He did this so that he could die for every person. God is so good! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Everything was made for God and by God. It seemed good to him that Jesus’ life should be made complete, by going through the hard things that happened to him. This was because Jesus leads many people to heaven as God’s children. And he is the one who saves them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus, who makes people holy, and those who are made holy, all have one Father in heaven. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said, ‘I will tell my brothers about you. I will sing praise about you among those who gather together for worship.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He also said, ‘I will trust God.’ And again, ‘Here am I and the children God has given to me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">God’s children all have a body. That is why Jesus himself had the same. But because Jesus also had a body, he was able to die and stop the devil. The devil has power to make people die. But Jesus, by his own death, was able to stop the power of death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">People were afraid to die. All their lives they were like slaves. When Jesus died, he was able to set them free from their fear. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus did not come to help angels. He came to help people who were born in Abraham’s family. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he had to be made like his brothers in every way. Then he could be a high priest to make a way to God for them, a priest who was kind and true. He could make it possible for God to forgive people for the wrong things they had done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He had a very hard time when he was tested. But because he was tested, he is able to help people who are tested.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My brothers, you are holy. You are also called to go to heaven. Take time to think carefully about Jesus. God sent him. He is the high priest we believe in. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did what God sent him to do, just as Moses did in God’s house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Jesus is much greater than Moses–as the one who builds a house is greater than the house itself. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Every house is built by someone, but God is the one who builds all things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moses did what he was told to do as a servant in all of God’s house. He showed things that God would say later. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus Christ was true as a Son over God’s house. We are God’s house if we keep on believing and telling others what we hope to have. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So as the Holy Spirit says, ‘Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is what happened when the people tested me in the desert and I became angry. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There your fathers tested me and tried me. And they saw what I did for forty years. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I was very angry with the people of that time. I said, “Their minds are always dark. They have not known my ways.” </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I said when I was angry, “They will never go into my resting place.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My brothers, take care that not one of you has a heart that does not believe. Such a heart will take you away from the living God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But talk to each other every day while ‘Today’ lasts, so that wrong ways will not fool any one of you and your hearts become hard. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We have our part with Christ if we go on to the end and believe in him as we did at first. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">God is still saying now, ‘Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard. That is what happened when the people turned against me.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Who were the people who heard him and yet made him very angry? It was all the people whom Moses led out of the country of Egypt. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">With whom was God angry for forty years? He was angry with the people who had done wrong. And they died in the desert. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who were the people God said would never go into his resting place? They were the people who would not listen to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So then, we see that they could not go in because they did not believe him.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">We still have God’s promise that people will go into his resting place. So let us take care that not one of you will be kept out. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The good news has been told to us just as it was told to the people in the desert. But the message which they heard did not do them any good. Even though they heard it, they did not believe it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But we who believe, will go into that resting place of God. It is as God said, ‘When I was angry, I said, “They will never go into my resting place.”’ He said this even though his work had been finished ever since he had made the world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Here is what he said, somewhere in the holy writings, about the seventh day: ‘And God rested on the seventh day after doing all his work.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now here he says again, ‘They will never go into my resting place.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So that means some people will go in. But the people who first heard the good news about it did not go in. They did not believe it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he chose another day called ‘Today.’ He spoke through David many years later, who said, ‘Today, when you hear his voice, do not make your hearts hard.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If Joshua had led those people to rest, God would not have talked later about another day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So there is still a rest for God’s people, like a Sabbath day. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The person who goes into God’s resting place will rest after doing his work, just as God rested after doing his work. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So let us do our best to go into that resting place. Those people died in the wilderness because they did not believe. So let us take care that the same thing does not happen to one of us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">God’s word is living and full of power. It is more sharp than any sword that cuts on both sides. What God says cuts through and divides the mind and spirit. It cuts through and divides the place where the bones are joined, and the part inside the bone. What God says is able to judge the things people think and plan in their hearts. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God is the one we must meet. Nothing can be hidden from him. Everything is open and he can see it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We have a great high priest who has gone into heaven. He is Jesus, the Son of God. Because we have such a great high priest, let us hold on to the things we believe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We have a high priest who can feel with us when we are weak. He has been tested in every way, just as we are. But he did not do anything wrong. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So let us trust him when we come to worship God. He is so good. He will be kind to us and help us when we need it.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Every high priest is chosen from among men. His work is to stand before God for people. He brings gifts and makes sacrifices to God for the wrong things people have done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Such a high priest can be kind to people who do not know what is right and who do wrong. He knows how to share in the suffering of others because he himself is weak. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because he is weak himself, he must make sacrifices to God for the wrong things he has done, just as he does for the people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">No one chooses himself to be high priest. But God calls him, just as he called Aaron. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Christ did not choose himself to be a high priest. But he was chosen by the One who said to him, ‘You are my Son, and I am your Father today.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In another place in the holy writings God said, ‘You are a priest for ever like Melchizedek.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Jesus was a man, he talked to God who was able to save him from death. He called loudly to him with tears. God heard him because he honoured and respected God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Even though Jesus was his Son, he learned to obey God in the troubles he had. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When he became perfect, he saved for ever all who obeyed him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God called him a high priest like Melchizedek was a priest. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We have many things to say about him. But they are hard to explain to you. You are so slow to understand what we tell you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">By this time you should be able to teach others. But you need someone to teach you God’s word again from the very beginning. Like children, you need milk, not meat. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Anyone who takes milk does not understand the message about which things are right. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But meat is for people who are grown up. It is for people who have trained their minds to know the difference between what is good and what is bad.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So, let us leave behind the first teachings about Christ. And let us go on to things that are grown up. We must not go back to the beginning again and talk about turning away from doing things that bring death to us. We must not go back again and talk about believing in God. Let us go forward. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We must not go back to teaching about baptizing people in water, about putting hands on people’s heads, about people being raised from death, and about people being judged for ever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If God will let us, we will go on to build on these things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some people had light in their hearts once. They knew the gift from heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They had the Holy Spirit. They knew the word of God is good and felt the powers of the next world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If people who were like that leave their faith in Christ, they cannot come to God again. They themselves nail God’s Son up on the cross again. They are holding him up to shame before everyone. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The ground drinks the water that often rains on it. It makes plants grow for the people who take care of it. And God blesses that ground. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if it grows thorns and weeds, it is no good. It will soon be cursed. In the end, it will be burned with fire. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This is the way we talk. But dear people, we are sure that better things are true about you. Yes, you show all the good ways of people who have been saved from their wrong ways. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God does what is right. He will not forget your work and the love you have shown for him. You have helped God’s people and you are still helping them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We want every one of you to try in the same way. Then you will get what you hope for right up to the end. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Do not give up. But be like the people who get what God has promised. They believe God and keep on believing for a long time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God made a promise to Abraham. God did not have anyone greater than himself to hear his promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he promised to himself when he said, ‘I will surely bless you and you will have many children.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Abraham kept on believing God. And so he got what God had promised him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When men make a promise, they ask someone to hear it who is greater than they are. When someone great has heard a promise, it stops any quarrel about it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God made a promise to people. He wanted to show them that he would surely do as he said. So he promised to himself to keep the promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">These two things cannot be changed and God cannot lie about them. So we can trust him. We have run to him to get what he has promised us. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This promise gives our hearts something to hold on to. It keeps our hearts strong and steady. It will take us into the Holy Place right inside God’s house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus has gone there ahead of us. He has been made high priest for ever like Melchizedek.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem. He was a priest of God who is the greatest of all. Melchizedek met Abraham when Abraham came back from killing some bad kings. And Melchizedek blessed him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham divided all that he took away from the kings into ten parts. He gave Melchizedek one part. First, the name Melchizedek means the king who is true and right with God. Then he was king of Salem. That means king of peace. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He has no father or mother. The names of the family from which he comes are not written down. It is not written down that he was born or that he died. But, like the Son of God, he stays on being a priest for ever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Just think how great he was! Even Abraham, the father of our people, gave him a tenth, one part out of ten, of all he brought back. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sons of Levi, who are priests, have the right by law to take a tenth of what the people have. These people are their own brothers. They also are Abraham’s children. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Melchizedek was not from Levi’s family. Yet he took a tenth of what Abraham had. And he blessed Abraham, to whom God made the promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Everyone knows this is true. The person who is blessed is not so great as the person who blesses him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Here, priests take their tenth, but they are people who will die one day. But Melchizedek, who took his tenth, never dies. The holy writings say it is so. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And we say that Levi, the priest who takes the tenth from the people, gave his tenth through Abraham. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was not yet born when Melchizedek met Abraham. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It was while the sons of Levi were priests that the law was made for the people. If those priests were good enough, why would another priest need to come who was like Melchizedek? Why would he not be like Aaron? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If the kind of priest is changed, then the law must be changed also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The one we are talking about belonged to another tribe. No man from his tribe ever made sacrifices in God’s house. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Everyone knows that our Lord Jesus came from the tribe of Judah. And Moses never said anything about priests coming from that tribe. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You can understand it even better when another priest comes who is like Melchizedek. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He was not made a priest by law. The law said that the priest must come from a certain tribe. But he was made a priest because he has power to live for ever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This is what the holy writings say about him, ‘You are a priest for ever, like Melchizedek.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The old law given to Moses by God was put away. It was weak and no good. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The law did not make anything right. But something better has been brought to us. It is God’s promise. And by that promise we come near to God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Also Christ was not made a priest without God’s strong promise. The others were made priests without God’s strong promise. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this man was made priest by God’s strong promise. God said to him, ‘The Lord has made a strong promise, and he will not change it. “You are a priest for ever.”’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Also because of this, Jesus makes a better agreement with God for people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The other priests were many, because they died and could not go on with their work. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But because Jesus lives forever, he is a priest for ever and no one takes his place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because of that, he is able to save people for ever, if they come to God by him. He lives for ever to talk to God for them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">We needed such a high priest as he is. He is holy. He is good. He has never done any wrong. He has been taken away from among bad people, and taken up higher than the sky. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He does not need to make sacrifices every day. The other high priests make sacrifices every day, first for the wrong things they have done, and then for the people. He did it once when he offered himself as the sacrifice. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The law makes men high priests, and they are weak. But the word of God’s promise came after the law. It makes his Son high priest for ever, and he is all right.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The real point of what we are saying is this. We now have a high priest who sits beside God’s throne or chief chair in heaven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He is priest in the true holy place where God lives. The Lord made that place, man did not. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Every high priest is chosen to offer gifts and sacrifices. So this high priest must have something to offer also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If he were still on earth, he would not be a priest. There are priests on earth already who offer gifts the way the law says. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The work they do shows what the work of the priest in heaven is. When Moses made a house for God, here is what God told him to do. He said, ‘Be sure you make everything like I showed you on the mountain.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Christ has been given a much better work, because he is the man who is between God and men in making an agreement. This is a much better agreement. It was made by better promises. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If the first agreement had been all right, there would have been no need to make another. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the people had done wrong, God’s words to them were, ‘The days will come, the Lord says, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It will not be like the agreement that I made with their fathers. I made that agreement the day I led them by the hand out of the country of Egypt. But they did not keep their part of my agreement, so I left them alone, the Lord says. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">After those days, the Lord says, I will make an agreement with the people of Israel. This is my agreement. I will put my laws in their minds. I will write them in their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A man will not need to teach another man, or his brother. He will not say, “Know the Lord,” because everyone from the youngest to the oldest will know me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I will be kind even when they do what is not right, and I will never remember the wrong things they do.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God says this is a new agreement, and that makes the first one old. When a thing is old and no good, it is about ready to be thrown away.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first agreement had laws about worship. And it had a holy place on earth where the agreement was kept. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A house was made. In the first part of the house were the light, the table, and the bread of God. This first part was called the Holy Place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next part of the house was called the Most Holy Place. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In the Most Holy Place was a pan made of gold. In this pan a fire could burn to make a sweet-smelling smoke. The box of the agreement was also in the Most Holy Place. It was covered all over with gold. In this box were: the golden pot, which had some of the food God sent from heaven for the people in the desert; Aaron’s stick which grew flowers on it; and the stones which had God’s agreement written on them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On top of the box were the shapes of two angels. They showed that God is great. Their wings spread over the cover of the box. It was the place where God showed that he is kind. But we cannot take time to tell about every part of these things now. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These things were made ready. The priests always went into the first part of the house to do their work for God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But only the high priest went into the second part. And he went in only once a year. He never went in without taking blood with him. He gave the blood to God for the wrong things he had done and for the wrong things people had done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This is how the Holy Spirit showed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not yet open to everybody. It was not open as long as the first house was still standing. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This first part is a picture of the time we are in now. In it gifts and sacrifices are made to God. But they cannot make a person’s heart clean to worship God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These are only things to eat and drink and different kinds of washings. They are laws made for the body until the time when everything is made right again. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ has come as the high priest of the good things which have come. He went through a greater and better house which was not made by men’s hands. It is not a part of this world. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He did not take the blood of goats and young cows. He took his own blood. And he went into the Most Holy Place just once. He paid for our sins and made us free for ever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The priest takes the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes from a young cow that has been burned. He puts this on the people who have done wrong things. This makes their bodies clean. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If the blood of animals can do that, then the blood of Christ will clean our hearts much better. Christ gave himself to God as the sacrifice. He did this by the Spirit who lives for ever. He was a perfect sacrifice. He will clean our hearts from useless acts of worship. Then we can serve the living God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That is why he is the middle man of a new agreement. He died and paid for the wrong things that were done under the first agreement. Because he is a middle man, those people who are called by God can have what he promised. This will belong to them for ever. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">A person can say who will get his things when he dies. He writes this agreement down. Before anyone can have them, it must be proved that the person has died. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The agreement has no power until the one who made it has died. It has no power as long as the one who made it is living. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So even the old agreement made by God was not begun without blood. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moses told all the people every part of the law. Then he took the blood of young cows and goats. He put some of the blood on the book of the law itself and on all the people. He took water and red wool and a plant called hyssop. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As he did this, he said, ‘This is the blood for the agreement which God has made for you.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In the same way, he put some of the blood on the house he had made for God, and on all the things that were used in worship. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yes, by the old law almost everything is made clean with blood. If no animal is killed to give blood, then there is no way for people to be forgiven for the wrong things they have done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">These things on earth show in a little way what things in heaven are like. The things on earth had to be cleaned by the blood of animals. But the things in heaven had to be cleaned with better sacrifices than these. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Christ did not go into a holy place made by men’s hands. The holy places on earth only show in a little way what the true holy place in heaven is like. He went into heaven itself. Now he stands before God for our sake. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Christ did not have to offer himself as a sacrifice many times. He is not like the high priest who went into the Holy Place every year and took blood that was not his own blood. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If Christ were like him, he would have had to die many times ever since the world was first made. But as it is now, Christ came once in the last days of the world. He came to clean away what is wrong by giving himself as a sacrifice. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">People must die, and after that they will be judged. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Christ gave himself as a sacrifice only once. He took on himself the wrong things many people have done. He will come a second time. But he will not come to do anything about the wrong things people have done. He will come to save those who are looking and waiting for him.      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The law can show only a little about the good things that are coming. It cannot show the good things themselves. People come to worship God. But the law can never make them all right by the same sacrifices that are brought every year. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If the law could make people all right, they would stop making sacrifices. The people who come to worship would be made clean for all time, and they would not remember the wrong things they had done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But, by making these sacrifices, they show that they do remember the wrong things they have done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The blood of bulls and goats can never clean wrong things from people’s hearts. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That is why Christ said when he came into the world, ‘You did not want sacrifices and gifts. But you made a body for me. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Animals that are burned for sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away the wrong things that people do, did not satisfy you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, “See, I have come to do what you, God, want me to do.” This is what is written about me in the book of the law.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First he said, ‘You did not want sacrifices and gifts, and animals that are given to be burned as sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away people’s wrong ways. You did not like them.’ These sacrifices are made to obey the law. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he said, ‘See, I have come to do what you want me to do.’ He took away the first kind of sacrifices so that the second kind would remain. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God wanted us to be made holy. We have been made holy by Jesus Christ. He made us holy by once making his body a sacrifice. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Every priest stands day after day doing his work. He makes the same sacrifices many times. But these sacrifices can never clean away the wrong things people have done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Christ made one sacrifice to clean away their wrong ways for ever. Then he sat down beside God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Since then, he is waiting till his enemies are put under him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">By one sacrifice Christ has made right for ever all those people who are being made holy. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit tells us about this also. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">First he said, ‘This is the agreement that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts. I will write them in their minds.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he also said, ‘I will never remember the wrong things they have done and the times they did not obey.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When these wrong things have been forgiven, a sacrifice is not needed for them again. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So, my brothers, we can go into the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He made a new and living way for us. He opened up God’s way specially for us. It lets us through the big curtain or cloth which hides God from us. This happened when Jesus gave his body as a sacrifice. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Also, we have a high priest who has charge of God’s people. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So let us come to him with a true heart. Let us come because we believe all these things. Let us come with our hearts washed clean from our wrong ways. Let us come with our bodies washed with clean water. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">We must hold on to God’s promise that we have said we believed. And we must never let go. He has promised and he will do it. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Let us think of one another and help one another to love and to do good things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Do not stop going to church meetings. Some people do stop. But help each other to be strong. You must do it all the more as you see the Great Day coming closer. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Do we go on doing what is wrong after we know the truth? If we do, then there is no sacrifice any more for the wrong things we do. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But we will be judged, and that makes us fear. God’s anger will be like a very hot fire that will burn up those who are against him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Any man who broke the law of Moses was killed, if two or three people proved that he had broken the law. He will not be forgiven. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But the person who should have much bigger punishment is the one who turns against the Son of God. That person was made holy by the blood of the new agreement and then calls it nothing. He no longer honours and respects the Spirit who has been so kind to him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">We know God who has said, ‘I am the one who will punish people. I will repay them.’ Also, ‘The Lord will judge his people.’ </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">People should fear very much to be punished by the living God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Remember the first days when you had the light of God’s truth. In those days you were strong, even though you had to fight against many troubles. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Sometimes it was because people said and did wrong things to you and everybody saw it. And sometimes it was because you stood with others who had wrong things done to them. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You shared in the troubles of those who were in prison. When your things were taken from you, you were happy. You knew that you had better things in heaven, things that would always belong to you. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Because Abel believed God, he made a sacrifice that pleased God more than the one Cain made. Because Abel believed God, God showed that he was good. God was pleased with his gifts. Abel died. But because he believed God, he still speaks to us through his faith. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Is any one of you in trouble? He should talk to God about it. Is any one of you happy? He should sing songs of praise to God. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is any one of you sick? He should call for the leaders of the church people. They should talk to God about him and put oil on him in the name of the Lord. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because they talk to God, and believe, he will hear them. The sick man will be healed. The Lord will make him well again. If the sick man has done wrong things, the Lord will forgive him. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So tell one another the wrong things you have done. And tell God about each other’s needs, so that you will be healed. When a good man talks to God, big things can be done. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man like us. He asked God not to let it rain. And for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then he talked to God again. And it rained. Plants grew on the earth. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My brothers, has one of you left the right way? Has another person brought him back again? </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not forget that the person who has brought a man back from his wrong ways will save that man from death. He will cover up many wrong things and be forgiven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I am Peter. I am an apostle of Jesus Christ. I send this letter to God’s chosen people. You are like people on a journey. You live in the countries of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. But you do not belong there. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God the Father chose you as he planned to do long ago. You were made holy by the Spirit. You were chosen to obey Jesus Christ and to be made clean by the blood of his death. May you have much blessing and peace. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He was very kind to us, and made us his children. So we have a new hope. This hope is a living hope because Jesus Christ was raised from death. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because we are God’s children, one day we shall receive special blessings. They cannot be spoiled in any way, and they will last for ever. They are kept safe in heaven for you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You are saved by God’s power because you believe. You will then be fully saved. The way is ready and you will see it when the end of time comes. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This makes you very glad, even though now maybe you are sad because you have troubles of many kinds. They are only for a short time. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To believe is worth more than to have gold. Gold can spoil, but it is tested by fire to show that it is good. So troubles test you to prove that you believe. Then, because you really believe, you will be praised and made great and have honour when Jesus Christ comes again. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You love him even though you have not seen him. You trust him even though you do not see him. And so you are very happy. No words can tell how happy you are. Your joy is very great. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God will reward you because you have believed. You will then be fully saved. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The prophets of God long ago told about this way of being saved. They tried to find out about it and asked much about it. They spoke words from God telling about the blessing God would give you. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Spirit of Christ in them showed them that Christ would have troubles and after that he would be great. They tried to find out when these things would happen or how things would be when they did happen. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit showed them that they told these things not for themselves, but for you. And now the men who told you the good news have told you these same things. They spoke by the power of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven. Even the angels wanted very much to know about these things. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So think clearly. Keep awake. When Jesus Christ comes, he will bring you blessing. Set all your hope on that. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Be children who obey. Do not be like what you were before you knew Christ. Then you did anything you wanted to do. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">You know this. You lived the way your fathers taught you to live, and it was not a good way to live. You were bought and set free from that way of life. But you were not bought with silver or gold money, which can spoil. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You were bought with blood that is worth much. It is like the blood of a sheep that is perfect with nothing wrong in its body. You were bought with the blood of Christ. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And to them he is also, ‘a stone on which people will hit their feet, and a rock that will make them fall down.’ They hit their feet on it, because they do not obey the word. It was planned that this would happen to them! </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But you are a chosen people. You are priests to your king. You are a holy nation. You are God’s very own people. All this is so that you will tell how good he is. He called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">At one time you were not God’s people. But now you are God’s people. At one time you did not know God’s kindness. Now you do. </VERS>

The right way to believe has been given to God’s people once for all times. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some men have come in quietly. They are bad men. The holy writings told us long ago that they would be punished.

      <VERS vnumber="12">These men spoil your love feasts. They are not afraid to eat and drink with you. They take care only of themselves.

These trees are also dead because they have been pulled up by the roots. </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">A name was written on her forehead. It has a secret meaning. The name is Great Babylon, the mother of all people who give their bodies for wrong ways of using sex. The mother of all things done on earth too bad to talk about. </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I saw the woman was drunk because of the blood she drank. It was the blood of God’s people, and the blood of people who had been killed because they belonged to Jesus. When I saw her, I was very much surprised. </VERS>
